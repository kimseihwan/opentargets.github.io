          The <a class="font-weight-bold" href="https://www.targetvalidation.org" target="_blank">Open Targets Platform </a>
          - previously called the Target Validation Platform - 
          is a freely available resource for the integration of genetics, omics and 
          chemical data to aid systematic drug target identification and prioritisation. 
          The Platform provides summaries of the evidence (e.g. germline variants, 
          somatic mutations, pathways, drugs) for the involvement of a specific gene with 
          a selected disease. It supports disease and target centric workflows, displays 
          the evidence for target-disease associations, as well as profiles of relevant 
          target and disease annotations. Please see
