### [Postdoctoral Fellowship - Statistical Genetics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellowship-statistical-genetics-416231.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: applications will be reviewed on an ongoing basis and early applications are strongly encouraged.*

Applications are invited for a 3-year Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Wellcome Sanger Institute based jointly in the teams of Dr. Carl Anderson and Dr. Maya Ghoussaini. This is an exciting opportunity for you to bring together cutting-edge genetic and genomic datasets to identify novel candidate therapeutic targets for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). During this fellowship, you will lead a multi-organisation collaborative project to build a causal evidence base for every gene within IBD associated GWAS loci. As a member of the Anderson group, you will also have access to the latest large-scale genetic association data for IBD, alongside functional genomics datasets derived from disease-relevant tissue in health and disease (single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq). Your affiliation with the Ghoussaini Team will bring access to the massive cross-disease genetic and genomic datasets aggregated by Open Targets and presented in both the Open Targets Platform and the Open Targets Genetics Portal. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellowship-statistical-genetics-416231.html)__

### [Statistical Geneticist](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/statistical-geneticist-open-targets-417064.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: applications will be reviewed on an ongoing basis and early applications are strongly encouraged.*

A Statistical Geneticist role is available at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in the Open Targets Genetics team under the leadership of Dr. Maya Ghoussaini. This is an exciting opportunity for you to participate in the enhancement of the Open Targets Genetics Portal through the development of new functionality and features. The Open Targets Genetics portal uses cutting-edge methods to aggregate large scale GWAS data with functional genomics data to identify potential drug targets at disease-associated loci. In this role, you will be actively engaged in the integration of new GWAS data (FinnGen, Biobank Japan, etc), eQTL datasets including splice QTLs and tissue-specific functional genomic datasets. You will develop and apply computational pipelines to elucidate causal mechanisms through integrative analyses of data from GWAS, eQTL/pQTL, chromatin interactions and conformation, biobanks, and other related sources to identify and prioritise drug targets. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/statistical-geneticist-open-targets-417064.html)__
