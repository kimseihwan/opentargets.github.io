### [Postdoctoral Fellow - Single Cell Genomics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-single-cell-genomics-386309.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 16 June 2019*

Applications are invited for a 3-year Postdoctoral Fellowship within the Genomics of Inflammation and Immunity group at the Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI), headed by [Dr. Carl Anderson](http://www.andersonlab.info). The project will generate single-cell transcriptomic data from intestinal biopsies obtained from 300 healthy individuals undergoing colonoscopy. All individuals will also be genotyped, with the goal of combining these datasets to map eQTLs across the more than forty different cell-types in the gut. The results from these analyses will then be combined with our detailed maps of IBD risk loci (and other gastrointestinal diseases) to identify genes that are dysregulated to bring about disease. The ultimate goal of the research is thus to improve our basic knowledge of IBD pathogenesis and identify novel candidate drug targets for treating disease. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-single-cell-genomics-386309.html)__

### [Postdoctoral Fellow: Bioinformatician, Immunology](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=HD01542)
*An EMBL-Heidelberg contract - closing date: 23 June 2019*

The research group of Lars Steinmetz seeks for an ambitious computational postdoctoral fellow to lead an intersectoral functional genomics project with the aim of dissecting the genetic basis of immune diseases. The project aims to achieve a deep understanding of immune-disease etiology by combining technologies, including single-cell transcriptomics, genomics, and CRISPR/Cas9. You will develop and apply computational methods to analyze large-scale functional genomics and single-cell transcriptomics datasets and to integrate and interpret data. This project will be strongly supported by a dedicated experimental scientist, along with our industry partners at GSK/Cellzome.. __[[read more]](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=HD01542)__
