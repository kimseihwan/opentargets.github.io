#### [Scientific Curator](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI_00965&newlang=1)
*Variation Annotation team at the EMBL-EBI*  
Closing date: 29 June 2017

We are looking for a curator to join the Variation Annotation team at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) located on the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus near Cambridge in the UK. Our work involves extraction of detailed scientific information from published scientific papers into the Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) Catalog. As part of the OpenTargets Array Prioritisation project this position will focus on extracting data to support the Open Targets project. This will provide evidence for possible therapeutic targets.

#### [Research Assistant - Experimental Cancer Genetics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=317806)
*Dr David Adamsâ€™s group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute*  
Closing date: 14 July 2017

A new project funded by Open Targets, joint between the Experimental Cancer Genetics group headed by Dr David Adams at WTSI and GSK immuno-oncology, is to perform in depth analysis of Natural Killer (NK) cell surface protein interactors. The first phase of this project is a protein microarray screen to identify ligands for orphan NK cell receptors and to identify additional interactions. Following on from the identification of these ligand/receptor pairs their expression in normal tissue and tumours will be investigated. Finally, the functional importance of these pairs will be interrogated using a variety of assays.

We are looking for an enthusiastic individual to contribute to the generation of this data using a variety of laboratory techniques such as cell culture including manipulation of genes, flow cytometry, gene and protein expression analysis. Detailed record keeping is required, as is contribution to data analysis, review and reporting.
