### [Statistical Geneticist](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=371402)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 28 February 2019*

A Statistical Geneticist role funded by Open Targets, is available at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in a new team under the leadership of Dr. Maya Ghoussaini. This is an exciting opportunity for you to participate in the enhancement of the existing [Open Targets Genetics Portal](https://genetics.opentargets.org) through the development of new functionality and features. You will actively engage in the integration of new eQTL datasets and tissue-specific chromatin interaction datasets.

### [Scientist Curator - Genetic Drivers of Cancer](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=377809)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 10 March 2019*

[COSMIC](http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk) is working with Open Targets to expand the worldâ€™s most comprehensive description of the genes causing human cancer, the Cancer Gene Census. This is an exciting position within the COSMIC team, where you will have the opportunity to explore & interpret a wide range of literature, database and analytic resources to create a complete landscape of genetic dysfunctions across all cancer types and explain which molecular mechanisms are most important in development of these diseases. ... __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=377809)__

### [Advanced Research Assistant](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=377013)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 18 March 2019*

A position is available for a talented Advanced Research Assistant to join an interdisciplinary, highly collaborative team of clinicians, academic and drug discovery researchers. This is an exciting opportunity for the successful candidate to apply 10X Genomics single cell RNA-sequencing of gut biopsies ascertained from 160 inflammatory bowel disease patients and 300 healthy controls. The goal of the project is to identify genetic variants that are associated with gene expression in intestinal cells, and then combine these with IBD GWAS data to identify potential novel drug targets for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). ... __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=377013)__

### [Postdoctoral Fellow - Complex Disease Genetics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=377008)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 18 March 2019*

Applications are invited for a 3-year Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Wellcome Sanger Institute based jointly in the teams of Dr. Carl Anderson (Human Genetics Programme, www.andersonlab.info) and Dr. Maya Ghoussaini (Open Targets). This is an exciting opportunity for you to bring together cutting-edge genetic and genomic datasets to identify novel candidate therapeutic targets for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). During this fellowship, you will lead a collaborative project to build a causal evidence base for every gene within IBD associated GWAS loci. Your affiliation with the Ghoussaini Team will bring access to the massive cross-disease genetic and genomic datasets aggregated by Open Targets and presented in their web-based resources - [the Open Targets Platform](https://www.targetvalidation.org/) and [the Open Targets Genetics Portal](https://genetics.opentargets.org/). As a member of the Anderson group, you will also have access to the latest large-scale genetic association data for IBD. ... __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=377008)__

### [Postdoctoral Fellow - Single Cell Genomics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=377005)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 18 March 2019*

Applications are invited for a 3-year Postdoctoral Fellowship within the Genomics of Inflammation and Immunity group at the Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI), headed by Dr. Carl Anderson (www.andersonlab.info). The project will generate single-cell transcriptomic data from intestinal biopsies obtained from 300 healthy individuals undergoing colonoscopy. All individuals will also be genotyped, with the goal of combining these datasets to map eQTLs across the more than forty different cell-types in the gut. The results from these analyses will then be combined with our detailed maps of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) risk loci (and other gastrointestinal diseases) to identify genes that are dysregulated to bring about disease. The ultimate goal of the research is thus to improve our basic knowledge of IBD pathogenesis and identify novel candidate drug targets for treating disease. ... __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=377005)__
