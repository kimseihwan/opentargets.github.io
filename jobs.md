### [Postdoctoral Fellow - CRISPR screening and QTL mapping in neurodegeneration - 2 positions](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-crispr-screening-and-qtl-mapping-in-neurodegeneration-405888.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 17 January 2020*

Two postdoctoral positions are available that provide an exciting opportunity to use human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived microglia to screen for genes involved in neurodegeneration, especially Alzheimerâ€™s disease. The positions will be based at the Wellcome Sanger Institute under the leadership of Dr Andrew Bassett, Dr Gosia Trynka and Dr Daniel Gaffney, and will also involve working with collaborators at the University of Oxford.  __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-crispr-screening-and-qtl-mapping-in-neurodegeneration-405888.html)__
