#### [Advanced Research Assistant: Genetic Screens in Dementia](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=324029)
*Rick Livesey’s group at the Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute (WTSI contract)*
Closing date: 30 August 2017

An Advanced Research Assistant position is available in Rick Livesey’s group at the Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute, as part of a translational initiative led by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute called Open Targets (https://www.opentargets.org). This is a collaborative project between Dr Rick Livesey, Dr Ludovic Vallier (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute; WTSI) and Dr Heike Hering (Biogen).

The successful candidate will be based in the centre of Cambridge at the Gurdon Institute, where they will contribute to the optimisation and execution of robust CRISPR – Cas9 based screening assays to identify targets that modulate a key process in the progression of Alzheimer’s disease using neurons induced from human pluripotent stem cells (IPSC). We welcome candidates with a background in cell biology, molecular biology and/or neurobiology with experience in performing cell and molecular biological assays. Experience in mammalian cell culture and flow cytometry are desirable, as is a background with handling human IPSC.

Selected candidates will be contacted for interview and references by the 31st of August. The interview date is fixed and will take place on the 5th of September.
