### [Open Targets Platform Coordinator - Open Targets Core Team](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI01323)
*An EMBL-EBI contract - closing date: 14 February 2019*

We are looking for an experienced bioinformatician, computer scientist or drug discovery scientist to provide leadership for the core Open Targets Platform project involved in large-scale biological data analysis and integration for drug target identification and prioritisation.

The position is based in dedicated Open Targets space within EMBL-EBI and reports to the Open Targets Scientific Director.

Responsibilities will involve setting the scientific strategy for the OT Platform and related projects, day to day management of core database projects, including the team that generates the OT Platform, and setting priorities in line with agreed strategy together with a Project Manager. The postholder will synthesise strategy from input from multiple stakeholders within the Open Targets partnership, in the context of current thinking in the field of target identification and prioritisation. In addition, the post holder will have accountability for establishing and maintaining release schedules and ensuring stability and reproducibility of production systems.

The post represents an excellent opportunity to lead the development of the core data integration within Open Targets and to be involved in a rapidly evolving field ... __[read more](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI01323)__

### [Statistical Geneticist](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=371402)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 28 February 2019*

Open Targets has recently launched Open Targets Genetics (https://genetics.opentargets.org), a portal that aggregates large scale GWAS data with functional genomics data to identify potential drug targets at disease-associated loci.

A Statistical Geneticist role funded by Open Targets, is available at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in a new team under the leadership of Dr. Maya Ghoussaini. This is an exciting opportunity for you to participate in the enhancement of the existing Open Targets Genetics Portal through the development of new functionality and features. You will actively engage in the integration of new eQTL datasets and tissue-specific chromatin interaction datasets. ... __[read more](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=371402)__

### [Advanced Research Assistant](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=377013)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 18 March 2019*

A position is available for a talented Advanced Research Assistant to join an interdisciplinary, highly collaborative team of clinicians, academic and drug discovery researchers. This is an exciting opportunity for the successful candidate to apply 10X Genomics single cell RNA-sequencing of gut biopsies ascertained from 160 inflammatory bowel disease patients and 300 healthy controls. The goal of the project is to identify genetic variants that are associated with gene expression in intestinal cells, and then combine these with IBD GWAS data to identify potential novel drug targets for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). ... __[read more](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=377013)__

### [Postdoctoral Fellow - Complex Disease Genetics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=377008)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 18 March 2019*

Applications are invited for a 3-year Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Wellcome Sanger Institute based jointly in the teams of Dr. Carl Anderson (Human Genetics Programme, www.andersonlab.info) and Dr. Maya Ghoussaini (Open Targets). This is an exciting opportunity for you to bring together cutting-edge genetic and genomic datasets to identify novel candidate therapeutic targets for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD is a chronic and debilitating disease of the gastrointestinal tract that affects 0.5% of the European population. The etiological basis is poorly understood and, as a result, existing therapeutics often fail, leaving patients to face life-changing surgical procedures. 

During this fellowship, you will lead a collaborative project to build a causal evidence base for every gene within IBD associated GWAS loci. Your affiliation with the Ghoussaini Team will bring access to the massive cross-disease genetic and genomic datasets aggregated by Open Targets and presented in their web-based resources - [the Open Targets Platform](https://www.targetvalidation.org/) and [the Open Targets Genetics Portal](https://genetics.opentargets.org/). As a member of the Anderson group, you will also have access to the latest large-scale genetic association data for IBD. ... __[read more](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=377008)__

### [Postdoctoral Fellow - Single Cell Genomics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=377005)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 18 March 2019*

Applications are invited for a 3-year Postdoctoral Fellowship within the Genomics of Inflammation and Immunity group at the Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI), headed by Dr. Carl Anderson (www.andersonlab.info). Our group uses large-scale genetic and genomic data to understand the biological basis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) risk and progression. The ultimate goal of our IBD research is to identify new drug targets for the disease, and ascertain which individuals should be prescribed a given drug.

The project will generate single-cell transcriptomic data from intestinal biopsies obtained from 300 healthy individuals undergoing colonoscopy. All individuals will also be genotyped, with the goal of combining these datasets to map eQTLs across the more than forty different cell-types in the gut. The results from these analyses will then be combined with our detailed maps of IBD risk loci (and other gastrointestinal diseases) to identify genes that are dysregulated to bring about disease. The ultimate goal of the research is thus to improve our basic knowledge of IBD pathogenesis and identify novel candidate drug targets for treating disease. ... __[read more](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=377005)__
