### [Postdoctoral Fellow - Statistical Genetics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-statistical-genetics-399701.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 20 October 2019*

Applications are invited for 3-year Postdoctoral Fellowships within the Genomics of Inflammation and Immunity group at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, headed by Dr. Carl Anderson. Our group uses large-scale genetic and genomic data to understand the biological basis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) risk and progression. The ultimate goal of our IBD research is to identify new drug targets for the disease, and ascertain which individuals should be prescribed a given drug. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-statistical-genetics-399701.html)__

### [Postdoctoral Fellow - Functional Genomics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-functional-genomics-400441.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 3 November 2019*

We are looking to appoint a computational postdoctoral fellow in functional genomics to work with Emma Davenport and Gosia Trynka's groups at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. As part of an interdisciplinary team of experimentalists, clinical and industry collaborators you will lead an exciting project to map expression quantitative trait loci using large scale single cell RNA-seq data generated from 500 healthy and immune disease patients (sceQTLs).  Our goal is to accelerate drug discovery by integrating immune disease GWAS (Genome-wide associations studies) variants with the sceQTLs maps generated in this project to identify the most promising therapeutic targets for follow up by the industry partners working closely with us. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-functional-genomics-400441.html)__
