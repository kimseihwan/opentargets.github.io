### [Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI01432)
*An EMBL-EBI contract - closing date: 19 July 2019*

This is an exciting opportunity to work at the cutting edge of evidence generation in fast moving field of drug target identification and prioritisation. You will be embedded in a dynamic team working with cloud based technologies, integrating evidence from across EMBL-EBI and other databases to identify and prioritise drug targets. The post will involve use of natural language processing to develop comprehensive entity recognition, testing and refinement of entity dictionaries, building a knowledge graph combining literature relationships with other evidence from the [Open Targets Platform](https://www.targetvalidation.org) and machine learning to predict novel relationships including disease-target associations and drug repurposing opportunities. __[[read more]](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI01432)__

### [Postdoctoral Fellow - Experimental Data Generation](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-experimental-data-generation-391940.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 27 July 2019*

A position is now available for a highly motivated Postdoctoral Fellow to join the research group of Dr. Ana Cvejic, Dr Peter Campbell and Open Targets partners at the Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI). The project will combine state-of-the-art single-cell experimental data generation with computational analysis using novel methods to reveal the full spectrum of transcriptional and epigenetic changes that are associated with myeloid progenitors' migration and differentiation at the tumour sites. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-experimental-data-generation-391940.html)__

### [Postdoctoral Fellow - Functional Genomics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-functional-genomics-391778.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 28 July 2019*

We are looking to appoint a computational postdoctoral fellow in functional genomics to work with [Emma Davenport's](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/groups/davenport-group) and [Gosia Trynka's](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/groups/trynka-faculty) research groups at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. As part of an interdisciplinary team of experimentalists and clinical and industry collaborators you will lead an exciting project to map expression quantitative trait loci using large scale single cell RNA-seq data generated from 500 healthy and immune disease patients (sceQTLs). This is an excellent opportunity to be engaged in all aspects of a large-scale project and is particularly suitable for a candidate with a mix of experimental and computational expertise and an ambition to dive into the analysis of a large single cell dataset. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-functional-genomics-391778.html)__

### [Senior Bioinformatician](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI01469)
*An EMBL-EBI contract - closing date: 13 August 2019*

The Open Targets Platform Data Team analyse and collate the data that enters the Platform and build the appropiate models for integrating and scoring targets-disease associations. We are seeking an enthutiastic Senior Bioinformatician to lead the Data team within the Open Targets Platform. The post holder will not only lead current and future challenges in data integration and data analysis, but also collaborate closely with data providers across the Open Targets consortia. The Senior Bioinformatician will help to interpret large-scale biological data in the context of drug discovery, including data from some of our research projects utilising the latest technologies (i.e. CRISPR screenings, single-cell transcriptomics, etc.). __[[read more]](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI01469)__
