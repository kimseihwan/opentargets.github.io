### [Statistical Geneticist](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/statistical-geneticist-open-targets-411749.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 10 March 2020*

A Statistical Geneticist role is available at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in the Open Targets Genetics team under the leadership of Dr. Maya Ghoussaini. This is an exciting opportunity for you to participate in the enhancement of the existing [Open Targets Genetics Portal](https://genetics.opentargets.org/) through the development of new functionality and features. In this role, you will be actively engaged in the integration of new GWAS data (FinnGen, Biobank Japan, etc), eQTL datasets including splice QTLs and tissue-specific functional genomic datasets. You will develop and apply computational pipelines to elucidate causal mechanisms through integrative analyses of data from GWAS, eQTL/pQTL, chromatin interactions and conformation, biobanks, and other related sources to identify and prioritise drug targets. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/statistical-geneticist-open-targets-411749.html)__

### [Postdoctoral Fellow - CRISPR screening and QTL mapping in neurodegeneration](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-crispr-screening-and-qtl-mapping-in-neurodegeneration-414163.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 16 March 2020*

We have an exciting opportunity for a postdoctoral researcher to join an interdisciplinary team on an ambitious project aimed to identify new genes involved in neurodegeneration, especially Alzheimerâ€™s disease. The successful candidate will use human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived microglia coupled with cutting edge high-throughput single cell 'omics techniques to assay the effects of natural and induced genetic variation on gene expression and cellular phenotypes. The overall aim is to identify novel genes involved in important microglial cellular processes that are relevant for disease biology and will therefore be candidate drug targets for further development. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-crispr-screening-and-qtl-mapping-in-neurodegeneration-414163.html)__

### [Software Developer](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI01577)
*An EMBL-EBI contract - closing date: 27 March 2020*

We are seeking a talented backend software engineer to join the Open Targets Core Team in the development of the Open Targets Genetics Portal, an open-source research tool that leverages the increasing amount of human genetic data to help scientists identify and prioritise potential drug targets. You will join a dynamic and multidisciplinary team that uses a range of cutting-edge technologies to process, store, and aggregate the vast amount of human genetic data available. You will have the opportunity to build on our most recent statistical genomics analysis pipelines and provide a robust and scalable infrastructure to support public and private instances of the Genetics Portal. Our current technologies include ElasticSearch, Spark, ClickHouse and a variety of Google Cloud Platform services including Dataproc and BigQuery.  __[[read more]](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI01577)__
