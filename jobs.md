### [Postdoctoral Fellow - Functional Genomics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-functional-genomics-400441.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 3 November 2019*

We are looking to appoint a computational postdoctoral fellow in functional genomics to work with Emma Davenport and Gosia Trynka's groups at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. As part of an interdisciplinary team of experimentalists, clinical and industry collaborators you will lead an exciting project to map expression quantitative trait loci using large scale single cell RNA-seq data generated from 500 healthy and immune disease patients (sceQTLs).  Our goal is to accelerate drug discovery by integrating immune disease GWAS (Genome-wide associations studies) variants with the sceQTLs maps generated in this project to identify the most promising therapeutic targets for follow up by the industry partners working closely with us. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-functional-genomics-400441.html)__
