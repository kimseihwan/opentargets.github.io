#### [Advanced Research Assistant - Experimental Cancer Genetics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=367796)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract*
Closing date: 9 November 2018

With the completion of the human genome and analysis of variation across multiple individuals, attention is now turning to the functional analysis of genes in mammals and their validation as therapeutic targets. Open Targets aims to provide evidence on the biological validity of therapeutic targets and provide an initial assessment of the likely effectiveness of pharmacological intervention on these targets, using genome-scale experiments and analysis. This pioneering public-private partnership between Biogen, Celgene, EMBL-EBI, GlaxoSmithKline, Takeda, and the Wellcome Sanger Institute, aims to provide an R&D framework that applies to all aspects of human disease, and to share its data openly with the scientific community (http://www.opentargets.org).

A new project funded by Open Targets, joint between the Experimental Cancer Genetics group headed by Dr David Adams at the Wellcome Sanger Institute together with Open Targets partners, is to perform in depth analysis of factors that control T cell survival and differentiation within the tumour microenvironment. This will involve the use of bespoke targeted CRISPR screens applied to primary cells and using in vivo tumour models in order to identify novel candidate genes and/or pathways for validation and in-depth characterization.

We are looking for an enthusiastic individual to contribute to the generation of this data including cell culture and performing in vivo tumour models. Detailed record keeping is required, as is contribution to data analysis, review and reporting.
