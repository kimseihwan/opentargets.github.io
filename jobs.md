### [Postdoctoral Fellowship - Statistical Genetics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellowship-statistical-genetics-416231.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: applications will be reviewed on an ongoing basis and early applications are strongly encouraged.*

Applications are invited for a 3-year Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Wellcome Sanger Institute based jointly in the teams of Dr. Carl Anderson and Dr. Maya Ghoussaini. This is an exciting opportunity for you to bring together cutting-edge genetic and genomic datasets to identify novel candidate therapeutic targets for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). During this fellowship, you will lead a multi-organisation collaborative project to build a causal evidence base for every gene within IBD associated GWAS loci. As a member of the Anderson group, you will also have access to the latest large-scale genetic association data for IBD, alongside functional genomics datasets derived from disease-relevant tissue in health and disease (single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq). Your affiliation with the Ghoussaini Team will bring access to the massive cross-disease genetic and genomic datasets aggregated by Open Targets and presented in both the Open Targets Platform and the Open Targets Genetics Portal. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellowship-statistical-genetics-416231.html)__

### [Postdoctoral Fellow - CRISPR screening and QTL mapping in neurodegeneration](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-crispr-screening-and-qtl-mapping-in-neurodegeneration-414163.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 16 March 2020*

We have an exciting opportunity for a postdoctoral researcher to join an interdisciplinary team on an ambitious project aimed to identify new genes involved in neurodegeneration, especially Alzheimerâ€™s disease. The successful candidate will use human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived microglia coupled with cutting edge high-throughput single cell 'omics techniques to assay the effects of natural and induced genetic variation on gene expression and cellular phenotypes. The overall aim is to identify novel genes involved in important microglial cellular processes that are relevant for disease biology and will therefore be candidate drug targets for further development. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-crispr-screening-and-qtl-mapping-in-neurodegeneration-414163.html)__

### [Software Developer](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI01577)
*An EMBL-EBI contract - closing date: 27 March 2020*

We are seeking a talented backend software engineer to join the Open Targets Core Team in the development of the Open Targets Genetics Portal, an open-source research tool that leverages the increasing amount of human genetic data to help scientists identify and prioritise potential drug targets. You will join a dynamic and multidisciplinary team that uses a range of cutting-edge technologies to process, store, and aggregate the vast amount of human genetic data available. You will have the opportunity to build on our most recent statistical genomics analysis pipelines and provide a robust and scalable infrastructure to support public and private instances of the Genetics Portal. Our current technologies include ElasticSearch, Spark, ClickHouse and a variety of Google Cloud Platform services including Dataproc and BigQuery.  __[[read more]](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI01577)__

### [Senior Research Assistant](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/senior-research-assistant-415335.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 31 March 2020*

We are seeking an enthusiastic and motivated scientist to provide experimental, scientific and operational support to the Open Targets Validation Lab at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. This exciting opportunity will involve working with world-leading experts from both academia and industry across multiple disease areas, including oncology, neurodegeneration, and immunology. You will perform target perturbation using CRISPR-Cas9, RNAi and small molecule inhibitors in a variety of experimental model systems. Your work will involve the use of liquid handling equipment to facilitate medium-throughput processing of multiple targets, and state of the art live-cell and high-content imaging will be part of multiple assay endpoints.__[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/senior-research-assistant-415335.html)__

### [Computational Postdoctoral Research Scientist](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/computational-postdoctoral-research-scientist-415102.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 2 April 2020*

We are looking for a computational postdoctoral fellow to drive a collaborative project between Dr Gosia Trynka group at Wellcome Sanger Institute and Prof Matthias Zilbauer at the University of Cambridge. This research project aims at investigating the role of transcriptional mechanisms in regulating human intestinal epithelial cell function in health and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The project will use established access to a large patient cohort providing human intestinal tissue for the generation of organoids and single cell transcriptomics for profiling. You will integrate this data with results from CRISPR-screens to identify pathways relevant for prioritisation of new drug targets for IBD. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/computational-postdoctoral-research-scientist-415102.html)__
