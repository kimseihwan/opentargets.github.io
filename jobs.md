### [Senior Staff Scientist](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/senior-staff-scientist-393305.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 18 August 2019*

We are seeking an enthusiastic, motivated senior staff scientist to lead the establishment and operation of the Open Targets Validation Lab at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. This exciting opportunity will involve working with world experts from both academia and industry to validate target lists generated by Open Targets projects from multiple disease areas such as oncology and neurodegeneration. You will lead the Validation Lab to complement the work of the original project teams by operating in a systematic, medium throughput manner to provide independently generated evidence to provide further evidence for these targets, taking them a step closer to a drug development pipeline. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/senior-staff-scientist-393305.html)__

### [Computational Postdoctoral Fellow - Cancer Drug Combinations](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/computational-postdoctoral-fellow-cancer-drug-combinations-394157.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 20 August 2019*

The [Garnett lab](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/groups/garnett-group) is seeking a computational postdoctoral scientist to use CRISPR-Cas9 screening in cancer cell lines to identify and investigate new target combination for cancer. The position involves development of analytical and statistical approaches to model gene-gene interactions using large-scale CRISPR screening datasets, and combining these results with genomic data, transcriptomic and proteomic datasets. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/computational-postdoctoral-fellow-cancer-drug-combinations-394157.html)__

### [Advanced Research Assistant - Open Targets](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/advanced-research-assistant-open-targets-395437.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 24 August 2019*

We are looking for a highly-motivated, self-driven person to join the Trynka group at Wellcome Sanger Institute as a Senior Research Assistant and provide us with experimental support. Our goal is to use genetic approaches to identify gene pathways that are driving autoimmune diseases and to propose novel targets for therapeutic validation. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/advanced-research-assistant-open-targets-395437.html)__

### [Advanced Research Assistant - Open Targets](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/advanced-research-assistant-open-targets-395158.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 28 August 2019*

We are looking for a highly-motivated, self-driven person to join as an Advanced Research Assistant and provide an experimental support for the group. The prospective candidate will work with Gosia Trynka and Emma Davenportâ€™s groups at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. Our goal is to use genetic approaches to identify gene pathways that are driving autoimmune diseases and to propose novel targets for therapeutic validation. As a part of an interdisciplinary team of experimentalists, clinical and industry collaborators you will lead the generation of a large scale single cell RNA-seq data from 500 healthy and immune disease patients (sceQTLs). Ideally, you already have experience working with single cell RNA-seq technologies and with primary human immune cells. Due to the scale of the project, excellent organisational skills are critical. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/advanced-research-assistant-open-targets-395158.html)__

### [Postdoctoral Fellow (Computational Genomics)](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-computational-genomics-394572.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 29 August 2019*

The post-doctoral fellow will lead the large-scale computational analyses of RNA-seq datasets from cellular models for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diseases. In this project we are generating transcriptomic profiles from iPSC derived neural cells with CRISPR-engineered mutations modelling ~100 neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders due to mutations in chromatin-related genes, as well as transcriptomic profiles from drug response profiles of hundreds of pharmacological and genetic perturbations. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-computational-genomics-394572.html)__

### [Postdoctoral Fellow - Functional Genomics, Immunology](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=HD01565)
*An EMBL-Heidelberg contract - closing date: 8 September 2019*

The research group of Lars Steinmetz seeks for a highly motivated postdoctoral fellow to lead the experimental work on an intersectoral functional genomics project with the aim to dissect the genetic basis of immune diseases. The project aims to develop a deep understanding of immune disease etiology by applying state-of-the-art single-cell transcriptomics and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to disease-relevant primary cell culture model systems. You will lead study design and perform experiments, including large-scale functional genomics screens and single-cell transcriptomics in human T-cells and other cells of the immune system. The project will be strongly supported by a dedicated computational scientist, along with our industry partners at GSK/Cellzome. __[[read more]](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=HD01565)__

### [Open Targets Informatics Science Director](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI01486&newlang=1&pos[]=0&loc[]=2)
*An EMBL-EBI contract - closing date: 19 September 2019*

The Informatics Science Director will develop new projects together with key scientists from the partner institutions (EMBL-EBI, Wellcome Sanger Institute, GSK, Biogen, Celgene, Takeda and Sanofi) by screening all potential projects and developing suitably aligned projects through to resourcing. The role may involve application for grants to secure additional funding around Open Targets science. __[[read more]](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI01486&newlang=1&pos[]=0&loc[]=2)__
