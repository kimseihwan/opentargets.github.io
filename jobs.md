### [Computational Biologist/Bioinformatician](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=383908)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 25 May 2019*

A Computational Biologist/Bioinformatician role funded by Open Targets, is available at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in a new team under the leadership of Dr. Maya Ghoussaini. This is an exciting opportunity for you to participate in the enhancement of the existing [Open Targets Genetics](https://genetics.opentargets.org/) through the development of new functionality and features.

You will have the opportunity to work across a range of analysis such as:
* Integrate genetic and cell-specific genomic data to identify and validate casual links between targets and diseases and improve the Genetics Portal
* Perform association analysis on UK Biobank data with a particular focus on therapeutic areas important for Open Targets
* Work together with other members of the Open Targets team on statistical genetics analysis for large scale sequence analysis

 You will also have the opportunity to interact with active computational and experimental research teams using cutting edge genomic techniques.  __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=383908)__

### [Protein Computational Scientist](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI01392)
*An EMBL-EBI contract - closing date: 26 May 2019*

An exciting opportunity has been created for a talented scientist to work on methods to assess and quantify the tractability (also known as “druggability” or “ligandability”) of potential new targets for drug discovery. Reporting to the ChEMBL team leader, you will develop, assess and validate methods for quantifying target tractability with the ultimate goal of incorporating such methodologies into the [Open Targets Platform](https://www.targetvalidation.org/) building upon and extending our [current algorithms](https://docs.targetvalidation.org/getting-started/target-tractability). We now wish to develop new approaches based on protein structure and sequence, exploit the full spectrum of drug discovery data in ChEMBL and explore new modalities beyond the current small molecule and antibody pipelines. As part of the EU Horizon 2020 EOSC-Life project, you will work with collaborators across Europe to deliver pipelines that integrate data and computational methods in cloud-based environments.  __[[read more]](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI01392)__
