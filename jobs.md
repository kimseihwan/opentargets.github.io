#### [Research Associate (Fixed Term) - UK Dementia Research Institute (UK DRI) Centre at the University of Cambridge](http://www.jobs.cam.ac.uk/job/19307/)
*A University of Cambridge contract*
Closing date: 2 December 2018
Reference: ZE17189

Applications are invited for a postdoctoral research associate to join the team of Dr Emmanouil Metzakopian, in the newly established UK Dementia Research Institute (UK DRI) Centre at the University of Cambridge, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge UK to work on CRISPR screening and single cell analysis of iPSC-derived neurons.

The mission of the UK DRI at the University of Cambridge, is to create a collaborative, inter-disciplinary Centre, combining world-leading expertise unique to Cambridge from chemistry, biophysics and structural biology with internationally leading research in the cell biology of neurodegeneration. This environment will enable creative and innovative approaches to the study of neurodegenerative disease and drive a gear change in our scientific understanding.

The scientific focus of the Centre is on understanding mechanisms involved in the earliest stages of neurodegenerative disease in order, ultimately, to deliver therapeutic targets with the greatest potential to prevent dementia. Three Foundation programmes led by DRI professors are complemented by three new programmes led by DRI Fellows (including Dr. Metzakopian) to develop this field.

We are now looking for a postdoctoral research associate to join the laboratory of Dr. Emmanouil Metzakopian. The focus of the Metzakopian lab is on insights into novel neuroprotective mechanisms in neurodegeneration that provide new targets for treatments of these disorders.
