### [Senior Research Assistant- Immuno-oncology](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/senior-research-assistant-immunooncology-open-targets-400799.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 3 November 2019*

We are now seeking a senior research assistant (SRA) to join our team working on an exciting new project in the field of immuno-oncology. This project aims to discover the mechanisms that can modulate the reactivity of T-cells to the tumour. The position is laboratory based and will involve culturing 3D organoid cancer models and lymphocyte cultures, high-throughput drug testing, and performing CRISPR screens. The individual will be involved in research and development of new protocols, so will need to be adaptable to changing priorities and to work independently. It is expected that the successful candidate will be able to use their skills and experience to trouble shoot and innovate assays. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/senior-research-assistant-immunooncology-open-targets-400799.html)__

### [Postdoctoral Fellowship - Statistical Genetics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellowship-statistical-genetics-401589.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 10 November 2019*

Applications are invited for a 3-year Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Wellcome Sanger Institute based jointly in the teams of Dr. Carl Anderson (Human Genetics Programme, www.andersonlab.info) and Dr. Maya Ghoussaini (Open Targets). This is an exciting opportunity for you to bring together cutting-edge genetic and genomic datasets to identify novel candidate therapeutic targets for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). During this fellowship, you will lead a collaborative project to build a causal evidence base for every gene within IBD associated GWAS loci. Your affiliation with the Ghoussaini Team will bring access to the massive cross-disease genetic and genomic datasets aggregated by Open Targets and presented in their web-based portals (www.targetvalidation.org and https://genetics.opentargets.org). As a member of the Anderson group, you will also have access to the latest large-scale genetic association data for IBD. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellowship-statistical-genetics-401589.html)__

### [Postdoctoral Fellow - Functional Genomics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-functional-genomics-400441.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 8 December 2019*

We are looking to appoint a computational postdoctoral fellow in functional genomics to work with Emma Davenport and Gosia Trynka's groups at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. As part of an interdisciplinary team of experimentalists, clinical and industry collaborators you will lead an exciting project to map expression quantitative trait loci using large scale single cell RNA-seq data generated from 500 healthy and immune disease patients (sceQTLs).  Our goal is to accelerate drug discovery by integrating immune disease GWAS (Genome-wide associations studies) variants with the sceQTLs maps generated in this project to identify the most promising therapeutic targets for follow up by the industry partners working closely with us. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-functional-genomics-400441.html)__
