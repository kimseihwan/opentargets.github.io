### [Postdoctoral Fellowship - Statistical Genetics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellowship-statistical-genetics-416231.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: applications will be reviewed on an ongoing basis and early applications are strongly encouraged.*

Applications are invited for a 3-year Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Wellcome Sanger Institute based jointly in the teams of Dr. Carl Anderson and Dr. Maya Ghoussaini. This is an exciting opportunity for you to bring together cutting-edge genetic and genomic datasets to identify novel candidate therapeutic targets for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). During this fellowship, you will lead a multi-organisation collaborative project to build a causal evidence base for every gene within IBD associated GWAS loci. As a member of the Anderson group, you will also have access to the latest large-scale genetic association data for IBD, alongside functional genomics datasets derived from disease-relevant tissue in health and disease (single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq). Your affiliation with the Ghoussaini Team will bring access to the massive cross-disease genetic and genomic datasets aggregated by Open Targets and presented in both the Open Targets Platform and the Open Targets Genetics Portal. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellowship-statistical-genetics-416231.html)__

### [Statistical Geneticist](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/statistical-geneticist-open-targets-417064.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: applications will be reviewed on an ongoing basis and early applications are strongly encouraged.*

A Statistical Geneticist role is available at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in the Open Targets Genetics team under the leadership of Dr. Maya Ghoussaini. This is an exciting opportunity for you to participate in the enhancement of the Open Targets Genetics Portal through the development of new functionality and features. The Open Targets Genetics portal uses cutting-edge methods to aggregate large scale GWAS data with functional genomics data to identify potential drug targets at disease-associated loci. In this role, you will be actively engaged in the integration of new GWAS data (FinnGen, Biobank Japan, etc), eQTL datasets including splice QTLs and tissue-specific functional genomic datasets. You will develop and apply computational pipelines to elucidate causal mechanisms through integrative analyses of data from GWAS, eQTL/pQTL, chromatin interactions and conformation, biobanks, and other related sources to identify and prioritise drug targets. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/statistical-geneticist-open-targets-417064.html)__

### [Senior Research Assistant](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/senior-research-assistant-415335.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 31 March 2020*

We are seeking an enthusiastic and motivated scientist to provide experimental, scientific and operational support to the Open Targets Validation Lab at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. This exciting opportunity will involve working with world-leading experts from both academia and industry across multiple disease areas, including oncology, neurodegeneration, and immunology. You will perform target perturbation using CRISPR-Cas9, RNAi and small molecule inhibitors in a variety of experimental model systems. Your work will involve the use of liquid handling equipment to facilitate medium-throughput processing of multiple targets, and state of the art live-cell and high-content imaging will be part of multiple assay endpoints.__[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/senior-research-assistant-415335.html)__

### [Computational Postdoctoral Research Scientist](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/computational-postdoctoral-research-scientist-415102.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 2 April 2020*

We are looking for a computational postdoctoral fellow to drive a collaborative project between Dr Gosia Trynka group at Wellcome Sanger Institute and Prof Matthias Zilbauer at the University of Cambridge. This research project aims at investigating the role of transcriptional mechanisms in regulating human intestinal epithelial cell function in health and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The project will use established access to a large patient cohort providing human intestinal tissue for the generation of organoids and single cell transcriptomics for profiling. You will integrate this data with results from CRISPR-screens to identify pathways relevant for prioritisation of new drug targets for IBD. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/computational-postdoctoral-research-scientist-415102.html)__
