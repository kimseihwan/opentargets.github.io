### [Advanced Research Assistant - Open Targets](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/advanced-research-assistant-open-targets-395158.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 28 August 2019*

We are looking for a highly-motivated, self-driven person to join as an Advanced Research Assistant and provide an experimental support for the group. The prospective candidate will work with Gosia Trynka and Emma Davenportâ€™s groups at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. Our goal is to use genetic approaches to identify gene pathways that are driving autoimmune diseases and to propose novel targets for therapeutic validation. As a part of an interdisciplinary team of experimentalists, clinical and industry collaborators you will lead the generation of a large scale single cell RNA-seq data from 500 healthy and immune disease patients (sceQTLs). Ideally, you already have experience working with single cell RNA-seq technologies and with primary human immune cells. Due to the scale of the project, excellent organisational skills are critical. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/advanced-research-assistant-open-targets-395158.html)__

### [Postdoctoral Fellow (Computational Genomics)](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-computational-genomics-394572.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 29 August 2019*

The post-doctoral fellow will lead the large-scale computational analyses of RNA-seq datasets from cellular models for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diseases. In this project we are generating transcriptomic profiles from iPSC derived neural cells with CRISPR-engineered mutations modelling ~100 neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders due to mutations in chromatin-related genes, as well as transcriptomic profiles from drug response profiles of hundreds of pharmacological and genetic perturbations. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-computational-genomics-394572.html)__

### [Postdoctoral Fellow - Functional Genomics, Immunology](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=HD01565)
*An EMBL-Heidelberg contract - closing date: 8 September 2019*

The research group of Lars Steinmetz seeks for a highly motivated postdoctoral fellow to lead the experimental work on an intersectoral functional genomics project with the aim to dissect the genetic basis of immune diseases. The project aims to develop a deep understanding of immune disease etiology by applying state-of-the-art single-cell transcriptomics and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to disease-relevant primary cell culture model systems. You will lead study design and perform experiments, including large-scale functional genomics screens and single-cell transcriptomics in human T-cells and other cells of the immune system. The project will be strongly supported by a dedicated computational scientist, along with our industry partners at GSK/Cellzome. __[[read more]](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=HD01565)__

### [Advanced Research Assistant - Open Targets](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/advanced-research-assistant-open-targets-396675.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 8 September 2019*

We are looking for a highly motivated Advanced Research Assistant to join a collaborative, large-scale project that aims to understand the cellular basis of neurodevelopmental disorders. The prospective candidate will be involved in studying how mutations in chromatin modifying enzymes affect neuronal development and cause disease. The primary goal of the work is to culture and differentiate human iPS cells with and without mutations to neuronal cell types, and profile the cells with a range of cellular and genomic assays. This is an exciting opportunity to be engaged in all aspects of a cutting-edge research project, from planning and pilot work to data generation and novel discoveries.

The project forms part of the Open Targets collaboration (www.opentargets.org) and provides a unique opportunity to deliver translational science together with industry partners including GSK, Celgene, Sanofi, and Takeda. The prospective candidate will work at the Wellcome Sanger Institute with Dr. Helena Kilpinen and the Cellular Generation and Phenotyping (CGaP) core facility, collaborating closely with the Hurles group and other members of the Open Targets team. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/advanced-research-assistant-open-targets-396675.html)__

### [Open Targets Informatics Science Director](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI01486&newlang=1&pos[]=0&loc[]=2)
*An EMBL-EBI contract - closing date: 19 September 2019*

The Informatics Science Director will develop new projects together with key scientists from the partner institutions (EMBL-EBI, Wellcome Sanger Institute, GSK, Biogen, Celgene, Takeda and Sanofi) by screening all potential projects and developing suitably aligned projects through to resourcing. The role may involve application for grants to secure additional funding around Open Targets science. __[[read more]](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI01486&newlang=1&pos[]=0&loc[]=2)__
