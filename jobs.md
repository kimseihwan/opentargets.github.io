#### [Postdoctoral Fellow - Beltrao Research Team](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI_01249)
*An EMBL-EBI contract*
Closing date: 9 August 2018

We are looking for a Postdoctoral fellow to develop computational approaches to prioritize drugs and drug targets for cancer therapeutics.

Our group is generally interested in studying genotype to phenotype associations by taking into account structural and cell biology knowledge. Within this broad scope we have, for example, integrated different variant effect predictors (www.mutfunc.com) in order to interpret the molecular consequences that are intermediate between genotype and phenotype. The applicant would aim to develop novel frameworks to integrate cancer cell line CRISPR and drug screening information with other small-molecule, structural and proteomics data. The aims of this work would include the identification of novel drug targets, the study of drug mode-of-action and stratification of patients for therapeutics.

This project will be conducted in collaboration with members of the DepMap consortium (http://depmap.org/sanger). Together with other partners DepMap aims to identify targetable vulnerabilities in cancer cells. The groups involved in this project have characterized up to 1,000 cancer cell lines using high throughput omics approaches and have screened large scale drug panels to assess line-specific sensitivities. On-going work is now accessing for growth defects in gene knock out studies with CRISPR/Cas9. This initiative and this post are funded by OpenTargets (www.opentargets.org), a unique pre-competitive collaboration of companies and research institutions.

#### [Software Engineer - Open Targets Core Team](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI_01279)
*An EMBL-EBI contract*
Closing date: 9 September 2018

We are looking for a talented backend software engineer to join the Open Targets Core team. You will be involved in running large-scale biological data analysis and integration and developing APIs powering the Open Targets platform at www.targetvalidation.org and other new projects, and keeping our services performant across multiple geographical regions.

The main responsibilities will involve design and implementation of backend micro-services and data processing pipelines in Python or Scala on Unix-based systems, and maintenance of those services in a cloud environment (Google Cloud or AWS). There will be opportunities to design and implement REST and GraphQL web services in Flask and Play 2.

You will join a fast-paced, startup-like environment, where we use a range of modern technologies including ElasticSearch, Spark, ClickHouse and a variety of Google cloud services including Dataproc and BigQuery. We continuously look for improvement and follow Agile practices. You are encouraged to take ownership of what you work on.
