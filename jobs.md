#### [Ontologist/Software Developer](https://ig14.i-grasp.com/fe/tpl_embl01.asp?newms=jj&id=56464&newlang=1)
*An EMBL-EBI contract*
Closing date: 16 May 2018

The Samples, Phenotypes and Ontologies team are looking for an ontologist to drive development of the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) for the Open Targets project. Open Targets is a platform for target identification and prioritisation and performs large-scale biological data analysis and integration using EFO as the core ontology for the semantic annotation of data about disease and phenotype.

You will learn and develop state-of-the-art techniques in ontology building and apply these to real world datasets. You will be part of the team that develops the Experimental Factor Ontology and work on processes that support the construction and maintenance of the ontology and mapping the ontology to data that is integrated in Open Targets. You will build on existing software developed in the team and develop new pipelines that utilise open-source ontology software such as ROBOT. You will also extend a number of tools we have developed to support the construction of ontologies using ontology design patterns and spreadsheet templates (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/webulous). You’ll be expected to work on all aspects of the stack, as well as data processing pipelines behind the scenes to help acquire and process external ontologies.

#### [Senior Database Curator - Cancer Genetics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=347733)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract*
Closing date: 21 May 2018

We are seeking a motivated and experienced scientist in cancer informatics to play a crucial role in the expansion and curation of the Cancer Gene Census in the COSMIC team at the Sanger institute, Hinxton. In this project, we aim to describe in detail every cancer-causing gene and how its mutated dysfunction drives disease.

COSMIC (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk) is working with Open Targets (http://www.targetvalidation.org) to expand the world’s most comprehensive description of the genes causing human cancer. This is an exciting position within the COSMIC team, where you will have the opportunity to explore & interpret a wide range of literature, database and analytic resources to maximise the impact of this high-profile global resource, the Cancer Gene Census.

#### [Postdoctoral Fellow - Cancer Dependency Map Analytics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=349705)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract*
Closing date: 10th June 2018

The Wellcome Sanger Institute is seeking for a highly motivated researcher with strong skills in computational functional genomics to fill a postdoctoral fellow position, in collaboration with Open Targets. The aim of the fellow is to develop new algorithms and computational tools for the analysis of large-scale cancer pharmacogenomics and functional-genomics datasets to identify new oncology therapeutic targets and markers of gene-essentiality/drug-response.

To achieve this, the successful candidate will design methods to transform raw data into interpretable and predictive models via systematic statistical inference and unsupervised machine learning. Additionally, he will integrate data generated in house from large scale in-vitro drug/genome-editing screens with the multi-modal characterization of the underlying models and that of cancer patients (from publicly available resources) in order to: (i) optimize/identify the most clinically relevant molecular determinants of gene-essentiality/drug-response; (ii) prioritize potential new targets/therapeutic-markers on the basis of unmeet clinical needs and translational potential.

#### [Postdoctoral Fellow - Modeling Gene Essentiality in Cancer](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=350035)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract*
Closing date: 10th June 2018

The Wellcome Sanger Institute is seeking a highly motivated researcher with strong skills in computational genomics to fill a postdoctoral fellow position. The aim of the fellow is to develop a quantitative framework for predicting cancer vulnerabilities. To achieve this, the successful candidate will create generative probabilistic models that integrate the abundant data gathered in the international DepMap consortium for the available cancer cell lines, as well as apply deep neural networks and other suitable machine learning approaches to identify features to include in the model. Our collaborators in the consortium have world-leading expertise in cancer genomics to help guide model development.

The broader goal of the Cancer Dependency Map (http://depmap.org/sanger, and http://depmap.org/broad) is to identify a targetable vulnerability in every cancer cell. Ultimately, this will pave way for tumor-specific treatments. The groups involved have already characterized up to 1,000 cancer cell lines using high throughput genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic techniques, as well as applied large scale drug panels to assess line-specific sensitivities. Work is currently ongoing to identify genes that inhibit cell growth when knocked out using CRISPR/Cas9 -- these could then be used as targets for therapies. The initiative is funded by OpenTargets (www.opentargets.org), a unique pre-competitive collaboration of companies and research institutions. As part of this effort, positions are also available for a bioinformatician to process genome-wide knock-out screen data, and a postdoctoral fellow to identify new therapeutic targets, and molecular markers of response to genetic and small molecule perturbations.
