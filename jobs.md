#### [Advanced Research Assistant - Experimental Cancer Genetics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=373804)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract*

A new project funded by Open Targets, joint between the Experimental Cancer Genetics group headed by Dr David Adams at the Wellcome Sanger Institute together with Open Targets partners, is to perform in depth analysis of factors that control T cell survival and differentiation within the tumour microenvironment. This will involve the use of bespoke targeted CRISPR screens applied to primary cells and using in vivo tumour models in order to identify novel candidate genes and/or pathways for validation and in-depth characterization.

We are looking for an enthusiastic individual to contribute to the generation of this data including cell culture and performing in vivo tumour models. Detailed record keeping is required, as is contribution to data analysis, review and reporting.

__Closing date: 20 January 2019__

#### [Open Targets Platform Coordinator - Open Targets Core Team](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI01323)
*An EMBL-EBI contract*

We are looking for an experienced bioinformatician, computer scientist or drug discovery scientist to provide leadership for the core Open Targets Platform project involved in large-scale biological data analysis and integration for drug target identification and prioritisation.

The position is based in dedicated Open Targets space within EMBL-EBI and reports to the Open Targets Scientific Director.

Responsibilities will involve setting the scientific strategy for the OT Platform and related projects, day to day management of core database projects, including the team that generates the OT Platform, and setting priorities in line with agreed strategy together with a Project Manager. The postholder will synthesise strategy from input from multiple stakeholders within the Open Targets partnership, in the context of current thinking in the field of target identification and prioritisation. In addition, the post holder will have accountability for establishing and maintaining release schedules and ensuring stability and reproducibility of production systems.

The post represents an excellent opportunity to lead the development of the core data integration within Open Targets and to be involved in a rapidly evolving field.

#### [Statistical Geneticist](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=371402)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract*

A Statistical Geneticist role funded by Open Targets, is available at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in a new team under the leadership of Dr. Maya Ghoussaini. This is an exciting opportunity for you to participate in the enhancement of the existing [Open Targets Genetics Portal](https://genetics.opentargets.org/) through the development of new functionality and features.

You will actively engage in the integration of new eQTL datasets and tissue-specific chromatin interaction datasets.

You will have the opportunity to work across a range of analysis such as:

* Aggregate large scale GWAS data from multiple consortia and across a wide range of disease and traits.
* Perform association analysis on UK Biobank data with a particular focus on therapeutic areas important for Open Targets
* Work together with other members of the Open Targets team on statistical genetics analysis for large scale sequence analysis
* Work with existing members of the team to integrate genetic and cell-specific genomic data to identify and validate causal links between targets and diseases and improve the Genetics Portal.

We welcome candidates with a background in statistical genetics or relevant discipline with advanced level of programming skills suitable for statistical genetic analyses of complex diseases. Experience in functional genomics data analysis is highly desirable. You will have the opportunity to interact with active computational and experimental research teams using cutting edge genomic techniques.
