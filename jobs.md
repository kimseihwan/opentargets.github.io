#### [Bioinformatician - Open Targets Core Team](https://ig14.i-grasp.com/fe/tpl_embl01.asp?newms=jj&id=56579&aid=15470)
*An EMBL-EBI contract*
Closing date: 22 July 2018

Open Targets is a recently established public-private initative between the EBI, GlaxoSmithKline, Biogen, Takeda, Celgene and the Sanger Institute to combine large-scale genomic experiments with objective statistical and computational techniques to identify and validate the causal links between targets, pathways and diseases.

We are looking for an experienced bioinformatician for the core Open Targets platform project which is involved in large-scale biological data analysis and integration for target identification and prioritisation.

The postholder will join the Open Targets team developing the data processing and database infrastructure to provide the core deliverable of the centre, a genome-wide database of target validity (https://www.targetvalidation.org).

Responsibilities will involve development and refinement of suitable data feeds from databases within and outside the partnership including interaction with other groups, establishment of automated processing pipelines and quality control procedures, as well as exploratory data analysis in the area of target prioritisation.

In addition the post will involve extensive interaction with backend database developers to refine and test the data processing pipeline.
The post holder will work with an existing bioinformatician working on the core database, and report to the Open Targets Scientific Director.
