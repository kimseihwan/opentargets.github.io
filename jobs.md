#### [Data Scientist/Text Miner - ChEMBL Team](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI01282)
*An EMBL-EBI contract*
Closing date: 30 September 2018

An exciting opportunity has been created for a talented data scientist/text miner to work on project on text mining methods for the identification and extraction of drug discovery relevant data. The position is funded by the Open Targets initiative which is a public-private initiative between EMBL-EBI, GlaxoSmithKline, Biogen. Takeda, Celgene and the Sanger Institute to generate and integrate evidence on the validity of biological targets for drug development. The core Open Targets operations are based at the EMBL-EBI.   Based in the ChEMBL Team at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) you will work with the Open Targets partners develop pipelines to identify and integrate relevant information into the Open Targets Platform.
Your role
Reporting to the ChEMBL team leader, the job responsibilities will include:

* Developing text mining workflows for the identification of relevant scientific publications containing chemical probe and phenotypic assay data
* Classifying and organising the phenotypic assay data in the ChEMBL database using relevant ontologies
* Developing a text mining pipeline to identify and extract clinical trials outcomes from public data sources
* Working with the Open Targets partners to assess, validate and refine the resulting methods
* Working with Open Targets core team to integrate the data into the Open Targets Platform.

#### [Postdoctoral fellow (Immune Screening) - Experimental Cancer Genetic](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=364936)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract*
Closing date: 2 October 2018

With the completion of the human genome and analysis of variation across multiple individuals, attention is now turning to the functional analysis of genes in mammals and their validation as therapeutic targets. Open Targets aims to provide evidence on the biological validity of therapeutic targets and provide an initial assessment of the likely effectiveness of pharmacological intervention on these targets, using genome-scale experiments and analysis. 

A new project funded by Open Targets, joint between the Experimental Cancer Genetics group headed by Dr David Adams at the Wellcome Sanger Institute together with Open Targets partners, is to perform in depth analysis of factors that control T cell survival and differentiation within the tumour microenvironment. This will involve the use of bespoke targeted CRISPR screens applied to primary cells and using in vivo tumour models in order to identify novel candidates genes and/or pathways for validation and in-depth characterization.

We are looking for a talented Postdoctoral Fellow to be responsible for the immune aspect of this project to include the isolation and culture of the T cells required the in vivoscreens and their subsequent isolation from tissues. You will follow the validation and characterisation phases of the project.

Postdoctoral Fellows are typically in their first or second postdoctoral position as part of a period of early career research training. You are encouraged to apply if you have submitted your PhD thesis and you are awaiting your PhD award.
