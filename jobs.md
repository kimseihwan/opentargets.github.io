### [Postdoctoral Fellowship - Statistical Genetics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellowship-statistical-genetics-407895.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 17 January 2020*

Applications are invited for a 3-year Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Wellcome Sanger Institute based jointly in the teams of Dr. Carl Anderson (Human Genetics Programme) and Dr. Maya Ghoussaini (Open Targets). This is an exciting opportunity for you to bring together cutting-edge genetic and genomic datasets to identify novel candidate therapeutic targets for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). During this fellowship, you will lead a collaborative project to build a causal evidence base for every gene within IBD associated GWAS loci. Your affiliation with the Ghoussaini Team will bring access to the massive cross-disease genetic and genomic datasets used in the [Open Targets Platform](https://www.targetvalidation.org/) and the [Open Targets Genetics Portal](https://genetics.opentargets.org). And as a member of the Anderson group, you will also have access to the latest large-scale genetic association data for IBD. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellowship-statistical-genetics-407895.html)__
