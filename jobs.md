### [Postdoctoral Fellow - Complex Disease Genetics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=377008)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 21 April 2019*

Applications are invited for a 3-year Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Wellcome Sanger Institute based jointly in the teams of Dr. Carl Anderson (Human Genetics Programme, www.andersonlab.info) and Dr. Maya Ghoussaini (Open Targets). This is an exciting opportunity for you to bring together cutting-edge genetic and genomic datasets to identify novel candidate therapeutic targets for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). During this fellowship, you will lead a collaborative project to build a causal evidence base for every gene within IBD associated GWAS loci. Your affiliation with the Ghoussaini Team will bring access to the massive cross-disease genetic and genomic datasets aggregated by Open Targets and presented in [the Open Targets Platform](https://www.targetvalidation.org/) and [the Open Targets Genetics Portal](https://genetics.opentargets.org/). As a member of the Anderson group, you will also have access to the latest large-scale genetic association data for IBD. ... __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=377008)__

### [Postdoctoral Fellow - Single Cell Genomics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=377005)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 21 April 2019*

Applications are invited for a 3-year Postdoctoral Fellowship within the Genomics of Inflammation and Immunity group at the Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI), headed by Dr. Carl Anderson (www.andersonlab.info). The project will generate single-cell transcriptomic data from intestinal biopsies obtained from 300 healthy individuals undergoing colonoscopy. All individuals will also be genotyped, with the goal of combining these datasets to map eQTLs across the more than forty different cell-types in the gut. The results from these analyses will then be combined with our detailed maps of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) risk loci (and other gastrointestinal diseases) to identify genes that are dysregulated to bring about disease. The ultimate goal of the research is thus to improve our basic knowledge of IBD pathogenesis and identify novel candidate drug targets for treating disease. ... __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=377005)__

### [Senior Bioinformatician - Cancer Dependency Map Analytics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=380819)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 21 April 2019*

The Wellcome Sanger Institute is seeking an experienced Bioinformatician to join the the [Cancer Dependency Map Analytics team](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/groups/cancer-dependency-map-analytics) and provide computational analysis for the new international [Cancer Dependency Map](http://depmap.sanger.ac.uk/) consortium, whose broad goal is to identify vulnerabilities and dependencies that could be exploited therapeutically in every cancer cell. This is an exciting opportunity to work at one of the worldâ€™s leading genomic centres at the forefront of genomic research. You will have access to Sanger's computational resources, including a 15000+ core computational cluster, the largest in life science research in Europe, and multiple petabytes of high-speed cluster file systems. ... __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=380819)__

### [Computational Biologist/Bioinformatician](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=383908)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 25 May 2019*

A Computational Biologist/Bioinformatician role funded by Open Targets, is available at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in a new team under the leadership of Dr. Maya Ghoussaini. This is an exciting opportunity for you to participate in the enhancement of the existing [Open Targets Genetics Portal](https://genetics.opentargets.org/) through the development of new functionality and features.

You will have the opportunity to work across a range of analysis such as:

* Integrate genetic and cell-specific genomic data to identify and validate casual links between targets and diseases and improve the Genetics Portal
* Perform association analysis on UK Biobank data with a particular focus on therapeutic areas important for Open Targets
* Work together with other members of the Open Targets team on statistical genetics analysis for large scale sequence analysis

 You will also have the opportunity to interact with active computational and experimental research teams using cutting edge genomic techniques.  __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=383908)__
