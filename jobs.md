### [Postdoctoral Fellow - Functional Genomics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-functional-genomics-400441.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 8 December 2019*

We are looking to appoint a computational postdoctoral fellow in functional genomics to work with Emma Davenport and Gosia Trynka's groups at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. As part of an interdisciplinary team of experimentalists, clinical and industry collaborators you will lead an exciting project to map expression quantitative trait loci using large scale single cell RNA-seq data generated from 500 healthy and immune disease patients (sceQTLs).  Our goal is to accelerate drug discovery by integrating immune disease GWAS (Genome-wide associations studies) variants with the sceQTLs maps generated in this project to identify the most promising therapeutic targets for follow up by the industry partners working closely with us. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-functional-genomics-400441.html)__

### [Postdoctoral Fellow - CRISPR screening and QTL mapping in neurodegeneration - 2 positions](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-crispr-screening-and-qtl-mapping-in-neurodegeneration-405888.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 17 January 2020*

Two postdoctoral positions are available that provide an exciting opportunity to use human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived microglia to screen for genes involved in neurodegeneration, especially Alzheimerâ€™s disease. The positions will be based at the Wellcome Sanger Institute under the leadership of Dr Andrew Bassett, Dr Gosia Trynka and Dr Daniel Gaffney, and will also involve working with collaborators at the University of Oxford.  __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-crispr-screening-and-qtl-mapping-in-neurodegeneration-405888.html)__
