#### [Advanced Research Assistant - Experimental Cancer Genetics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=367796)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract*
Closing date: 9 November 2018

With the completion of the human genome and analysis of variation across multiple individuals, attention is now turning to the functional analysis of genes in mammals and their validation as therapeutic targets. Open Targets aims to provide evidence on the biological validity of therapeutic targets and provide an initial assessment of the likely effectiveness of pharmacological intervention on these targets, using genome-scale experiments and analysis. This pioneering public-private partnership between Biogen, Celgene, EMBL-EBI, GlaxoSmithKline, Takeda, and the Wellcome Sanger Institute, aims to provide an R&D framework that applies to all aspects of human disease, and to share its data openly with the scientific community (http://www.opentargets.org).

A new project funded by Open Targets, joint between the Experimental Cancer Genetics group headed by Dr David Adams at the Wellcome Sanger Institute together with Open Targets partners, is to perform in depth analysis of factors that control T cell survival and differentiation within the tumour microenvironment. This will involve the use of bespoke targeted CRISPR screens applied to primary cells and using in vivo tumour models in order to identify novel candidate genes and/or pathways for validation and in-depth characterization.

We are looking for an enthusiastic individual to contribute to the generation of this data including cell culture and performing in vivo tumour models. Detailed record keeping is required, as is contribution to data analysis, review and reporting.

#### [Research Associate (Fixed Term) - UK Dementia Research Institute (UK DRI) Centre at the University of Cambridge](http://www.jobs.cam.ac.uk/job/19307/)
*A University of Cambridge contract*
Closing date: 2 December 2018
Reference: ZE17189

Applications are invited for a postdoctoral research associate to join the team of Dr Emmanouil Metzakopian, in the newly established UK Dementia Research Institute (UK DRI) Centre at the University of Cambridge, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge UK to work on CRISPR screening and single cell analysis of iPSC-derived neurons.

The mission of the UK DRI at the University of Cambridge, is to create a collaborative, inter-disciplinary Centre, combining world-leading expertise unique to Cambridge from chemistry, biophysics and structural biology with internationally leading research in the cell biology of neurodegeneration. This environment will enable creative and innovative approaches to the study of neurodegenerative disease and drive a gear change in our scientific understanding.

The scientific focus of the Centre is on understanding mechanisms involved in the earliest stages of neurodegenerative disease in order, ultimately, to deliver therapeutic targets with the greatest potential to prevent dementia. Three Foundation programmes led by DRI professors are complemented by three new programmes led by DRI Fellows (including Dr. Metzakopian) to develop this field.

We are now looking for a postdoctoral research associate to join the laboratory of Dr. Emmanouil Metzakopian. The focus of the Metzakopian lab is on insights into novel neuroprotective mechanisms in neurodegeneration that provide new targets for treatments of these disorders.
