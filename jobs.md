### [Postdoctoral Fellow - Experimental Data Generation](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-experimental-data-generation-391940.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 27 July 2019*

A position is now available for a highly motivated Postdoctoral Fellow to join the research group of Dr. Ana Cvejic, Dr Peter Campbell and Open Targets partners at the Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI). The project will combine state-of-the-art single-cell experimental data generation with computational analysis using novel methods to reveal the full spectrum of transcriptional and epigenetic changes that are associated with myeloid progenitors' migration and differentiation at the tumour sites. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-experimental-data-generation-391940.html)__

### [Postdoctoral Fellow - Functional Genomics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-functional-genomics-391778.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 28 July 2019*

We are looking to appoint a computational postdoctoral fellow in functional genomics to work with [Emma Davenport's](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/groups/davenport-group) and [Gosia Trynka's](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/groups/trynka-faculty) research groups at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. As part of an interdisciplinary team of experimentalists and clinical and industry collaborators you will lead an exciting project to map expression quantitative trait loci using large scale single cell RNA-seq data generated from 500 healthy and immune disease patients (sceQTLs). This is an excellent opportunity to be engaged in all aspects of a large-scale project and is particularly suitable for a candidate with a mix of experimental and computational expertise and an ambition to dive into the analysis of a large single cell dataset. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-functional-genomics-391778.html)__

### [Senior Bioinformatician](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI01469)
*An EMBL-EBI contract - closing date: 13 August 2019*

The Open Targets Platform Data Team analyse and collate the data that enters the Platform and build the appropiate models for integrating and scoring targets-disease associations. We are seeking an enthutiastic Senior Bioinformatician to lead the Data team within the Open Targets Platform. The post holder will not only lead current and future challenges in data integration and data analysis, but also collaborate closely with data providers across the Open Targets consortia. The Senior Bioinformatician will help to interpret large-scale biological data in the context of drug discovery, including data from some of our research projects utilising the latest technologies (i.e. CRISPR screenings, single-cell transcriptomics, etc.). __[[read more]](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI01469)__

### [Senior Staff Scientist](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/senior-staff-scientist-393305.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 18 August 2019*

We are seeking an enthusiastic, motivated senior staff scientist to lead the establishment and operation of the Open Targets Validation Lab at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. This exciting opportunity will involve working with world experts from both academia and industry to validate target lists generated by Open Targets projects from multiple disease areas such as oncology and neurodegeneration. You will lead the Validation Lab to complement the work of the original project teams by operating in a systematic, medium throughput manner to provide independently generated evidence to provide further evidence for these targets, taking them a step closer to a drug development pipeline. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/senior-staff-scientist-393305.html)__

### [Postdoctoral Fellow - Functional Genomics, Immunology](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=HD01565)
*An EMBL-Heidelberg contract - closing date: 8 September 2019*

The research group of Lars Steinmetz seeks for a highly motivated postdoctoral fellow to lead the experimental work on an intersectoral functional genomics project with the aim to dissect the genetic basis of immune diseases. The project aims to develop a deep understanding of immune disease etiology by applying state-of-the-art single-cell transcriptomics and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to disease-relevant primary cell culture model systems. You will lead study design and perform experiments, including large-scale functional genomics screens and single-cell transcriptomics in human T-cells and other cells of the immune system. The project will be strongly supported by a dedicated computational scientist, along with our industry partners at GSK/Cellzome. __[[read more]](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=HD01565)__
