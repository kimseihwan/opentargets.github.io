#### [Bioinformatician - Open Targets Core Team](https://ig14.i-grasp.com/fe/tpl_embl01.asp?newms=jj&id=56579&aid=15470)
*An EMBL-EBI contract*
Closing date: 22 July 2018

Open Targets is a recently established public-private initative between the EBI, GlaxoSmithKline, Biogen, Takeda, Celgene and the Sanger Institute to combine large-scale genomic experiments with objective statistical and computational techniques to identify and validate the causal links between targets, pathways and diseases.

We are looking for an experienced bioinformatician for the core Open Targets platform project which is involved in large-scale biological data analysis and integration for target identification and prioritisation.

The postholder will join the Open Targets team developing the data processing and database infrastructure to provide the core deliverable of the centre, a genome-wide database of target validity (https://www.targetvalidation.org).

Responsibilities will involve development and refinement of suitable data feeds from databases within and outside the partnership including interaction with other groups, establishment of automated processing pipelines and quality control procedures, as well as exploratory data analysis in the area of target prioritisation.

In addition the post will involve extensive interaction with backend database developers to refine and test the data processing pipeline.
The post holder will work with an existing bioinformatician working on the core database, and report to the Open Targets Scientific Director.

#### [Postdoctoral Fellow - Beltrao Research Team](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI_01249)
*An EMBL-EBI contract*
Closing date: 9 August 2018

We are looking for a Postdoctoral fellow to develop computational approaches to prioritize drugs and drug targets for cancer therapeutics.

Our group is generally interested in studying genotype to phenotype associations by taking into account structural and cell biology knowledge. Within this broad scope we have, for example, integrated different variant effect predictors (www.mutfunc.com) in order to interpret the molecular consequences that are intermediate between genotype and phenotype. The applicant would aim to develop novel frameworks to integrate cancer cell line CRISPR and drug screening information with other small-molecule, structural and proteomics data. The aims of this work would include the identification of novel drug targets, the study of drug mode-of-action and stratification of patients for therapeutics.

This project will be conducted in collaboration with members of the DepMap consortium (http://depmap.org/sanger). Together with other partners DepMap aims to identify targetable vulnerabilities in cancer cells. The groups involved in this project have characterized up to 1,000 cancer cell lines using high throughput omics approaches and have screened large scale drug panels to assess line-specific sensitivities. On-going work is now accessing for growth defects in gene knock out studies with CRISPR/Cas9. This initiative and this post are funded by OpenTargets (www.targetvalidate.org), a unique pre-competitive collaboration of companies and research institutions.
