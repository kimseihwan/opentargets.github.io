### [Imaging Mass Spectrometrist](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=HD01538)
*An EMBL-Heidelberg contract - closing date: 7 July 2019*

The European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg is looking for an a university graduate with a degree in Analytical Chemistry (or related disciplines) to apply MALDI-imaging mass spectrometry methods to investigate metabolites, small molecules and/or lipids in immune human cells. __[[read more]](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=HD01538)__

### [Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI01432)
*An EMBL-EBI contract - closing date: 19 July 2019*

This is an exciting opportunity to work at the cutting edge of evidence generation in fast moving field of drug target identification and prioritisation. You will be embedded in a dynamic team working with cloud based technologies, integrating evidence from across EMBL-EBI and other databases to identify and prioritise drug targets. The post will involve use of natural language processing to develop comprehensive entity recognition, testing and refinement of entity dictionaries, building a knowledge graph combining literature relationships with other evidence from the [Open Targets Platform](https://www.targetvalidation.org) and machine learning to predict novel relationships including disease-target associations and drug repurposing opportunities. __[[read more]](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI01432)__

### [Postdoctoral Fellow - Experimental Data Generation](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-experimental-data-generation-391940.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 27 July 2019*

A position is now available for a highly motivated Postdoctoral Fellow to join the research group of Dr. Ana Cvejic, Dr Peter Campbell and Open Targets partners at the Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI). The project will combine state-of-the-art single-cell experimental data generation with computational analysis using novel methods to reveal the full spectrum of transcriptional and epigenetic changes that are associated with myeloid progenitors' migration and differentiation at the tumour sites. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-experimental-data-generation-391940.html)__

### [Postdoctoral Fellow - Single Cell Genomics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-single-cell-genomics-392297.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 28 July 2019*

Applications are invited for a 3-year Postdoctoral Fellowship within the Genomics of Inflammation and Immunity group at the Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI), headed by [Dr. Carl Anderson](http://www.andersonlab.info). The project will generate single-cell transcriptomic data from intestinal biopsies obtained from 300 healthy individuals undergoing colonoscopy. All individuals will also be genotyped, with the goal of combining these datasets to map eQTLs across the more than forty different cell-types in the gut. The results from these analyses will then be combined with our detailed maps of IBD risk loci (and other gastrointestinal diseases) to identify genes that are dysregulated to bring about disease. The ultimate goal of the research is thus to improve our basic knowledge of IBD pathogenesis and identify novel candidate drug targets for treating disease. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-single-cell-genomics-392297.html)__

### [Postdoctoral Fellow - Functional Genomics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-functional-genomics-391778.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 28 July 2019*

We are looking to appoint a computational postdoctoral fellow in functional genomics to work with [Emma Davenport's](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/groups/davenport-group) and [Gosia Trynka's](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/groups/trynka-faculty) research groups at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. As part of an interdisciplinary team of experimentalists and clinical and industry collaborators you will lead an exciting project to map expression quantitative trait loci using large scale single cell RNA-seq data generated from 500 healthy and immune disease patients (sceQTLs). This is an excellent opportunity to be engaged in all aspects of a large-scale project and is particularly suitable for a candidate with a mix of experimental and computational expertise and an ambition to dive into the analysis of a large single cell dataset. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-functional-genomics-391778.html)__
