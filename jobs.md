#### [Ontologist/Software Developer](https://ig14.i-grasp.com/fe/tpl_embl01.asp?newms=jj&id=56464&newlang=1)
*An EMBL-EBI contract*
Closing date: 16 May 2018

The Samples, Phenotypes and Ontologies team are looking for an ontologist to drive development of the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) for the Open Targets project. Open Targets is a platform for target identification and prioritisation and performs large-scale biological data analysis and integration using EFO as the core ontology for the semantic annotation of data about disease and phenotype.

ou will learn and develop state-of-the-art techniques in ontology building and apply these to real world datasets. You will be part of the team that develops the Experimental Factor Ontology and work on processes that support the construction and maintenance of the ontology and mapping the ontology to data that is integrated in Open Targets. You will build on existing software developed in the team and develop new pipelines that utilise open-source ontology software such as ROBOT. You will also extend a number of tools we have developed to support the construction of ontologies using ontology design patterns and spreadsheet templates (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/webulous). You’ll be expected to work on all aspects of the stack, as well as data processing pipelines behind the scenes to help acquire and process external ontologies.

*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract*
Closing date: 21 May 2018

We are seeking a motivated and experienced scientist in cancer informatics to play a crucial role in the expansion and curation of the Cancer Gene Census in the COSMIC team at the Sanger institute, Hinxton. In this project, we aim to describe in detail every cancer-causing gene and how its mutated dysfunction drives disease.

COSMIC (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk) is working with Open Targets (http://www.targetvalidation.org) to expand the world’s most comprehensive description of the genes causing human cancer. This is an exciting position within the COSMIC team, where you will have the opportunity to explore & interpret a wide range of literature, database and analytic resources to maximise the impact of this high-profile global resource, the Cancer Gene Census.
