### [Advanced Research Assistant - Open Targets](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/advanced-research-assistant-open-targets-396675.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 22 September 2019*

We are looking for a highly motivated Advanced Research Assistant to join a collaborative, large-scale project that aims to understand the cellular basis of neurodevelopmental disorders. The prospective candidate will be involved in studying how mutations in chromatin modifying enzymes affect neuronal development and cause disease. The primary goal of the work is to culture and differentiate human iPS cells with and without mutations to neuronal cell types, and profile the cells with a range of cellular and genomic assays. This is an exciting opportunity to be engaged in all aspects of a cutting-edge research project, from planning and pilot work to data generation and novel discoveries. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/advanced-research-assistant-open-targets-396675.html)__

### [Postdoctoral Fellow - Statistical Genetics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-statistical-genetics-399701.html)
*A Wellcome Sanger Institute contract - closing date: 20 October 2019*

Applications are invited for 3-year Postdoctoral Fellowships within the Genomics of Inflammation and Immunity group at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, headed by Dr. Carl Anderson www.andersonlab.info.

Our group uses large-scale genetic and genomic data to understand the biological basis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) risk and progression. The ultimate goal of our IBD research is to identify new drug targets for the disease, and ascertain which individuals should be prescribed a given drug. __[[read more]](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/postdoctoral-fellow-statistical-genetics-399701.html)__
