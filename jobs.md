#### [Postdoctoral Fellow - Beltrao Research Team](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI_01249)
*An EMBL-EBI contract*
Closing date: 9 August 2018

We are looking for a Postdoctoral fellow to develop computational approaches to prioritize drugs and drug targets for cancer therapeutics.

Our group is generally interested in studying genotype to phenotype associations by taking into account structural and cell biology knowledge. Within this broad scope we have, for example, integrated different variant effect predictors (www.mutfunc.com) in order to interpret the molecular consequences that are intermediate between genotype and phenotype. The applicant would aim to develop novel frameworks to integrate cancer cell line CRISPR and drug screening information with other small-molecule, structural and proteomics data. The aims of this work would include the identification of novel drug targets, the study of drug mode-of-action and stratification of patients for therapeutics.

This project will be conducted in collaboration with members of the DepMap consortium (http://depmap.org/sanger). Together with other partners DepMap aims to identify targetable vulnerabilities in cancer cells. The groups involved in this project have characterized up to 1,000 cancer cell lines using high throughput omics approaches and have screened large scale drug panels to assess line-specific sensitivities. On-going work is now accessing for growth defects in gene knock out studies with CRISPR/Cas9. This initiative and this post are funded by OpenTargets (www.targetvalidate.org), a unique pre-competitive collaboration of companies and research institutions.
