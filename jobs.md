### [Postdoctoral Fellow - Bioinformatician, Immunology](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=HD01542)
*An EMBL-Heidelberg contract - closing date: 23 June 2019*

The research group of Lars Steinmetz seeks for an ambitious computational postdoctoral fellow to lead an intersectoral functional genomics project with the aim of dissecting the genetic basis of immune diseases. The project aims to achieve a deep understanding of immune-disease etiology by combining technologies, including single-cell transcriptomics, genomics, and CRISPR/Cas9. You will develop and apply computational methods to analyze large-scale functional genomics and single-cell transcriptomics datasets and to integrate and interpret data. This project will be strongly supported by a dedicated experimental scientist, along with our industry partners at GSK/Cellzome.. __[[read more]](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=HD01542)__

### [Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI01432)
*An EMBL-EBI contract - closing date: 19 July 2019*

This is an exciting opportunity to work at the cutting edge of evidence generation in fast moving field of drug target identification and prioritisation. You will be embedded in a dynamic team working with cloud based technologies, integrating evidence from across EMBL-EBI and other databases to identify and prioritise drug targets. The post will involve use of natural language processing to develop comprehensive entity recognition, testing and refinement of entity dictionaries, building a knowledge graph combining literature relationships with other evidence from the [Open Targets Platform](https://www.targetvalidation.org) and machine learning to predict novel relationships including disease-target associations and drug repurposing opportunities. __[[read more]](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI01432)__
