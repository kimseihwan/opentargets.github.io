#### [Bioinformatician](https://www.embl.de/jobs/searchjobs/index.php?ref=EBI_00995&newlang=1)
*Open Targets core database at the EMBL-EBI*
Closing date: 30 July 2017

We are looking for an experienced Bioinformatician to be involved in large-scale biological data analysis and integration for target identification and prioritisation within the core Open Targets team. The post-holder will join the Open Targets team developing the data processing and database infrastructure to provide the core deliver of the centre, a genome-wide database of target validity (https://www.targetvalidation.org). Responsibilities will involve development and refinement of suitable data feeds from databases witin and outside the partnership including interaction with other groups, establishment of automated processing pipelines and quality control procedures, as well as exploratory data analysis in the area of target prioritisation.
In addition the post will involve extensive interaction with backend database developers to refine and test the data processing pipeline.

#### [Research Assistant - Experimental Cancer Genetics](https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/wd/plsql/wd_portal.show_job?p_web_site_id=1764&p_web_page_id=317806)
*Dr David Adamsâ€™s group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute*
Closing date: 14 July 2017

A new project funded by Open Targets, joint between the Experimental Cancer Genetics group headed by Dr David Adams at WTSI and GSK immuno-oncology, is to perform in depth analysis of Natural Killer (NK) cell surface protein interactors. The first phase of this project is a protein microarray screen to identify ligands for orphan NK cell receptors and to identify additional interactions. Following on from the identification of these ligand/receptor pairs their expression in normal tissue and tumours will be investigated. Finally, the functional importance of these pairs will be interrogated using a variety of assays.

We are looking for an enthusiastic individual to contribute to the generation of this data using a variety of laboratory techniques such as cell culture including manipulation of genes, flow cytometry, gene and protein expression analysis. Detailed record keeping is required, as is contribution to data analysis, review and reporting.
