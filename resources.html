          <p>
            The Open Targets Platform - previously called the Target Validation Platform - 
            is a freely available resource for the integration of genetics, omics and 
            chemical data to aid systematic drug target identification and prioritisation. 
            The Platform provides summaries of the evidence (e.g. germline variants, 
            somatic mutations, pathways, drugs) for the involvement of a specific gene with 
            a selected disease. It supports disease and target centric workflows, displays 
            the evidence for target-disease associations, as well as profiles of relevant 
            target and disease annotations. Please see
            <a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/D1/D1056/5193331" target="_blank">Carvalho-Silva et al. 2019</a>
            for more information on the Platform features and scoring methodologies.

          <p>
            Open Targets Genetics is a portal for investigation of Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) 
            data to assist in identifying the causal genes underlying each association, and hence to 
            prioritise drug targets. The portal aggregates and merges genetic associations curated from 
            literature and newly-derived loci from UK Biobank with (open source) functional genomics 
            data including epigenetics (e.g., chromatin conformation, chromatin interactions) and 
            quantitative trait loci (e.g., eQTLs from GTEX, pQTL), and applies statistical fine-mapping 
            across thousands of trait-associated loci, to resolve association signals and link each 
            variant to its proximal and distal target gene(s), using a single evidence score.

            Project Score is a web portal that allows researchers to explore the results of CRISPR-Cas9 whole-genome

            cancer cells to help guide precision cancer medicines. Please see

          <p>
            epiChoose is an application for quantifying the relatedness between cell lines and primary cells. 
            We have extensively profiled a number of commonly used cell line models across a number of tissues. 
            This profiling consists of epigenetic (histone modification, CTCF, ATAC-seq) and transcriptional 
            (RNA-seq) whole-genome measurements. From this data, we have established a platform that provides 
            information on the “distance” between candidate cell models and target primary cells. By ranking 
            and selecting cell line models in a data-driven manner, the best model for the experiment 
            can be chosen, based on epigenetic and transcriptional evidence and not historical usage.

          <p>
            CELLector is a computational tool implemented in an open source R Shiny application and R package that 
            allows researchers to select the most relevant cancer cell lines in a genomic-guided fashion. 
            CELLector combines methods from graph theory and market basket analysis; it leverages tumour genomics 
            data to explore, rank, and select optimal cell line models in a user-friendly way, enabling scientists 
            to make appropriate and informed choices about model inclusion/exclusion in retrospective analyses and 
            future studies. Additionally, it allows the selection of models within user-defined contexts, for 
            example, by focusing on genomic alterations occurring in biological pathways of interest or considering 
            only predetermined sub-cohorts of cancer patients. Finally, CELLector identifies combinations of 
            molecular alterations underlying disease subtypes currently lacking representative cell lines, providing 
            guidance for the future development of new cancer models. Please see

          <h3 class="text-center">DoRothEA</h3>
          <p>
            DoRothEA (Discriminant Regulon Expression Analysis) is a research resource that can be used to search 
            candidate TF-drug interactions in cancer. Due to their location as downstream effectors of signalling pathways, 
            aberrant activities in upstream driver genes (even if not mutated) will cause altered TF activities, thus 
            proposing TFs as sensors of pathway dysregulation and alternative markers. Here we study the role of 127 TFs in 
            drug sensitivity across ~1,000 cancer cell lines screened with 265 anti-cancer compounds from the GDSC. In our 
            first approach we studied how the TF activity pattern of an individual affects drug response and mined for single 
            TF-drug statistical interactions. In our second approach we screened for TFs whose activity patterns complement 
            or improve well-established genomic markers in the prediction of drug response. Please see

        <h3>CRISPRcleanR</h3>
        <p>
          Genome editing by CRISPR-Cas9 technology allows large-scale screening of gene essentiality in cancer. 
          A confounding factor when interpreting CRISPR-Cas9 screens is the high false-positive rate in detecting 
          essential genes within copy number amplified regions of the genome. We have developed the computational 
          tool CRISPRcleanR which is capable of identifying and correcting gene-independent responses to CRISPR-Cas9 
          targeting. CRISPRcleanR uses an unsupervised approach based on the segmentation of single-guide RNA fold 
          change values across the genome, without making any assumption about the copy number status of the 
          targeted genes. CRISPRcleanR is implemented as an R package and as an interactive Python package with 
          full documentation, tutorials, built in datasets to reproduce the results in this manuscript, and is 
          publically available as an <a href="https://github.com/francescojm/CRISPRcleanR" target="_blank">R package</a> 
          and as a <a href="https://github.com/cancerit/pyCRISPRcleanR" target="_blank">Python package</a>. 
          The Python implementation is dockerised making it platform-independent and 
          <a href="https://dockstore.org/containers/quay.io/wtsicgp/dockstore-pycrisprcleanr" target="_blank">usable in cloud environments</a>.
