        <h2>Scientific overview</h2>
        <p>
          We work in two areas to assist early drug target decisions. First, we integrate 
          publicly available information relevant to targets and diseases in the Open 
          Targets Platform. Second, we perform high throughput experimental projects that 
          generate target-centred data in human, physiologically relevant systems to 
          improve the strength of causal links between targets and diseases in our focus 
          therapeutic areas.

        <p class="mt-3">
          To deliver our projects Open Targets combines the expertise of its partners in 
          emerging and established technologies such as:
        </p>
        <ul class="mb-0">
          <li>
            Gene editing (CRISPR)
          </li>
          <li>
            Induced pluripotent stem cells
          </li>
          <li>
            Single cell genomics
          </li>
          <li>
            Organoid and tissue culture

        <h2>Collaborative experimental projects</h2>
        <p class="mb-5">
            Open Targets portfolio of experimental projects is designed to provide new 
            information in our key therapy areas to enable target identification and 
            prioritisation. We use high throughput methods to address as near as 
            possible the full range of relevant targets (ideally the whole genome) in 
            systems that are most relevant to the disease. We currently focus on 
            Oncology, Immunology and Neurodegeneration as therapeutic areas for Open 
            Targets both because they represent substantial unmet patient need, and 
            there is complementary expertise within the partners.
        </p>
        <h4>Oncology</h4>
        <p class="mb-5">
            Our projects in Oncology are connect to resources and expertise within the 
            Wellcome Sanger Institute’s cancer program, which has played an important 
            role in understanding the genetic basis of cancer. A shared theme is the 
            use of accessible cancer resources to curate and analyse clinical genomic 
            datasets to identify driver genes (mutations, amplification, deletions 
            and gene-fusions) across multiple cancer sub-types. A key resource is the 
            unique collection of >1000 human cancer cell lines at the Wellcome Sanger 
            Institute along with their drug sensitivities. Genomic information 
            including RNA-seq and synthetic lethality from genome editing in model 
            systems that best reflect the biology of tumours will identify new 
            target opportunities.
        </p>
        <h4>Immunology</h4>
        <p class="mb-5">
            We have initially focussed on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) where there 
            is both a strong interest from our partners and substantial expertise on 
            the Genome Campus. We have developed a state of the art meta-analysis for 
            the existing IBD cohorts, and will move candidate targets from this into 
            genome-wide knockouts in gut epithelium organoids for validation. We are 
            also partly supporting an inception cohort in the UK IBD BioResource, 
            where DNA, biopsies and stool will be collected for future genomic studies. 
            As Open Targets has progressed we have expanded to additional projects 
            probing the role of targets either in well-defined immune cells through 
            gene editing and epigenetic profiling (for instance in macrophages, 
            dendritic cells and T cells in response to various stimulations) or in 
            disease such as asthma using single cell genomics. A project to identify 
            receptor ligand pairs in NK cells with application in immune-oncology 
            crosses these two therapeutic areas.
        </p>
        <h4>Neurodegeneration</h4>
        <p>
            In Neurodegeneration we have used the collective expertise of our partners 
            and through collaboration with the Gurdon Institute built a set of projects 
            based around Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. These projects use similar 
            approaches to those described above, such as gene editing in neurons derived 
            from iPS cells to identify modifiers of the response to oxidative stress, 
            mechanism of Tau uptake and the effects of Alzheimer's disease specific 
            mutations. We are using fine mapping of GWAS in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson's 
            disease to identify and test potential targets in the same neuron systems and 
            also characterising these systems at the single cell genomics level.

        <h2>Core bioinformatics and data generation pipelines</h2>
        <p class="mb-5">
          The big challenge for our core bioinformatics work is how to bring together the 
          various, relevant data on targets in a way that allows simple & seamless exploration 
          by drug discovery scientists. We aim to cover many data types relevant to human 
          disease biology using the expertise from Open Targets partners and beyond.
        </p>
        <h4>Open Targets Platform</h4>
        <p>
          We have developed the Open Targets Platform to provide summaries of the evidence for 
          the involvement of a specific gene with a selected disease. The Platform was developed 
          together with scientists from our partners through a user experience (UX) design process. 
          The first public version of the Platform (version 1.0) was released at the Target 
          Validation Using Genomics and Informatics conference in December 2015. The Platform 
          supports searches that start at either a target or disease then displays the evidence for 
          associations, as well as profiles of relevant information for the target or disease through 
          state-of-the-art visualisations developed and tested via the UX process. We provide 
          programmatic data access via a supported public REST-API and provide examples on our API 
          tutorials.

        </div>
        <h4>Open Targets Genetics Portal</h4>
        <p>
          We have also developed the Open Targets Genetics Portal to provide a way for users to 
          investigate Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) data to assist in identifying the causal 
          genes underlying each assoication and to prioritise drug targets. The Portal was initially 
          launched during an interactive workshop at the American Society of Human Genetics conference 
          in October 2018. It supports searches that start with a gene, a single variant, a single 
          study (trait), or multiple studies and users can also download the data generated for each 
          Portal release.
