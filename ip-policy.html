          We place all our new informatics tools, experimental methods, platforms and the data generated by our 
          projects in the public domain as soon as is practical. 
        </p>
        <p>
          For raw data such as DNA sequencing, we follow the open release policies of our academic partners. 
          For our informatics tools and platforms, we use Open Source approaches as far as is possible. 
          We publish all our work as Open Access. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not routinely plan to seek patent protection for intellectual property (IP) arising from Open Targets. 
          However, we recognise that instances may arise where this is appropriate to support our mission. Therefore, 
          Open Targets has a panel of scientific and legal experts from all of our partners that reviews all potential 
          publications (but not raw data release) prior to submission.

          In practice, this means:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For the development and execution of Open Targets Research Projects each Member has agreed to license its 
            background IP to the other members
          </li>
          <li>
            All Members have agreed to license Open Targets arising IP to each other for use in Open Targets research 
            projects and for the members' research and development activities
          </li>
          <li>
            Any IP that relates directly and solely to an industry partner compound will belong to the industry partner
          </li>
          <li>
            Any other IP arising from an Open Targets Research Project will belong to the Member(s) that invented it
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
