# [Open Targets Platform](http://www.targetvalidation.org/)
We have developed the [Open Targets Platform](http://www.targetvalidation.org/) to provide summaries of the evidence for the involvement of a specific gene with a selected disease.

# [DoRothEA (Discriminant Regulon Expression Analysis)](http://dorothea.opentargets.io/#/)
[DoRothEA](http://dorothea.opentargets.io/#/) (Discriminant Regulon Expression Analysis) is a research resource that can be used to search candidate TF-drug interactions in cancer.

Due to their location as downstream effectors of signalling pathways, aberrant activities in upstream driver genes (even if not mutated) will cause altered TF activities, thus proposing TFs as sensors of pathway dysregulation and alternative markers. Here we study the role of 127 TFs in drug sensitivity across ~1,000 cancer cell lines screened with 265 anti-cancer compounds from the GDSC. In our first approach we studied how the TF activity pattern of an individual affects drug response and mined for single TF-drug statistical interactions. In our second approach we screened for TFs whose activity patterns complement or improve well-established genomic markers in the prediction of drug response.

Please see [Garcia-Alonso et al.](http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/21/129478) for an explanation of the approach.

# Open Targets Principles

Open Targets is guided by the following principles: 
*   We are focused on pre‐competitive research that will enable the systematic identification and prioritisation of targets
*   We are committed to rapid publication and making data, methods and results publically available as soon as possible
*   We believe in non‐exclusive partnerships that foster the free exchange of ideas and expertise
 
We place in the public domain all our new informatics tools, experimental methods, platforms and the data generated by our projects as soon as is practical. We do not plan to seek patent protection for IP arising from Open Targets. However, we recognise that instances may arise where this is appropriate to support our mission. Therefore, Open Targets has a Joint Patent Committee with scientific and legal experts from all of our partners that reviews all potential publications (but not raw data) prior to submission. 
 
In practice, this means:
*   For the development and execution of Open Targets Research Projects each Member has agreed to license its Background IP to the other members.
*   All Members have agreed to license Open Targets Arising IP to each other for use in Open Targets Research Projects and for the Members’ research and development activities.
*   Any IP that relates directly and solely to an Industry Partner Compound will belong to the Industry Partner.
*   Any other IP arising from an Open Targets Research Project will belong to the Member(s) that invented it.
