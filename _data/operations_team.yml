    Paris is the Open Targets Senior Administrator and provides day-to-day support to our Executive Leadership Team.
    Prior to joining the Open Targets team, she worked at the Wellcome Sanger Institute as the Human Genetics Team Administrator
    and oversaw the diary management and administrative support for five faculty members (Anderson, Barrett, Sandhu, Soranzo & Zeggini).

  biography: >
    Alice is an Operations Manager for Open Targets. Alice aims to use her scientific expertise and background in genomics to 
    facilitate the smooth running of Open Targets experimental projects that utilise cutting-edge technologies and approaches. 
    Alice also supports Open Targets core operations, combining her knowledge of large-scale genetic studies and skills in 
    project management, communication and strategic thinking. Alice works to the overall mission of the team; to create clarity, 
    fight chaos and make things happen across all aspects of Open Targets. Previously she worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow and 
    PhD student for Professor Nicole Soranzo in Human Genetics at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. Her scientific background 
    involved combining functional datasets with genetic studies to understand biological mechanisms at genetic risk loci and 
    identify potential novel targets. Alice's scientific background began in molecular and cellular biochemistry. During her 
    Masters research, she was supervised by Professor Shona Murphy at the William Dunn School of Pathology, and investigated 
    the mechanisms of transcriptional elongation of protein-coding genes. Later, Alice's PhD and postdoc research then combined 
    her established knowledge of biology with the analysis of large-scale genetic and genomic datasets to further understand 
    the functional consequences of regulatory genetic variation. In this work, she explored GWAS and genomic data in 
    haematopoietic cell types and combined molecular and functional data to systematically interrogate loci of clinical 
    importance. Alice's move to Open Targets was motivated by a desire to facilitate the translational benefit of genetics 
    research by building on her skills gained beyond the research environment.

  biography: >
    Sarah is an Operations Manager for Open Targets. She originally joined the Sanger Institute as a post-doctoral statistical 
    geneticist working on the genetics of complex diseases with a focus on Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), in particular, utilising 
    fine-mappng data to infer genes that are potential drug targets. She has a molecular biology background and moved from the 
    laboratory bench into statistical genetics during her PhD, which focused on the genetic analysis of the Colorectal Cancer 
    genome-wide association study (GWAS). Since then, she has developed my analytical skills through two post-doctoral positions 
    at King's College London. She has worked with GWAS, Immunochip finemapping and exome chip genotype data for a variety of international 
    collaborative projects in complex diseases such as psoriasis, cognitive ability and Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Her scientific interests 
    are focused on the genetic differences between individuals that confer an increased susceptibility to common diseases. 
    In her research, as part of Open Targets, she utilised publically available and in-house tools to analyse large scale genetic data with 
    the aim to identify target genes that may have therapeutic potential for diseases, such as IBD. More recently, Sarah has moved into a 
    research administrator role to facilitate the smooth running of Open Targets' research projects.
