    We are seeking a Statistical Geneticist to join the Open Targets Genetics team under the leadership of Dr. Maya Ghoussaini. 
    This is an exciting opportunity for you to participate in the enhancement of the <a href="http://genetics.opentargets.org" target="_blank">Open Targets Genetics Portal</a>
    through the development of new functionality and features. The Open Targets Genetics Portal uses cutting-edge methods to aggregate large scale GWAS data with functional genomics 
    data to identify potential drug targets at disease-associated loci. In this role, you will be actively engaged in the integration of new GWAS data (FinnGen, Biobank Japan, etc), 
    eQTL datasets including splice QTLs and tissue-specific functional genomic datasets. You will develop and apply computational pipelines to elucidate causal mechanisms through 
    integrative analyses of data from GWAS, eQTL/pQTL, chromatin interactions and conformation, biobanks, and other related sources to identify and prioritise drug targets.

    We are seeking an enthusiastic Bioinformatician to join our team and contribute to the development of the <a href="http://targetvalidation.org" target="_blank">Open Targets Platform</a>, 
    a freely-available, open-source tool that supports systematic drug target identification and prioritisation. As a member of the Data team within the broader Platform team, your role will involve 
    the integration and analysis of the most relevant data sources, as well as building the appropriate models for integrating and scoring targets-disease associations. The role also involves 
    collaborating closely with data providers across the Open Targets consortia and demonstrating initiative in the development and refinement of suitable data feeds. Supported by a team of 
    software developers, the postholder is expected to leverage the more than 50 data sources we integrate in the Platform, in order to better identify and prioritise potential drug targets.

    We are looking for an enthusiastic and talented Front-End Software Developer to join our team and help us build the next generation of open source and big data tools 
    and services that support the drug discovery process. As a key member of our technical team, you will work on developing and maintaining our two flagship open-source resources 
    - the <a href="http://www.targetvalidation.org" target="_blank">Open Targets Platform</a> and the <a href="http://genetics.opentargets.org" target="_blank"> Open Targets Genetics Portal</a>. 
    Together, these two resources integrate, organise, and present vast amounts of biomedical data in order to help research scientists identify and prioritise potential drug targets. 
    You will join a fast-paced, international, startup-like environment, where the latest technologies in front-end development and data visualisation are utilised to offer our users a best-in-class 
    experience and to influence decisions in the drug discovery area across the world.

    An exciting opportunity has been created for a talented scientist to work on the development of novel computational and informatics methods to improve target selection decision-making in drug discovery. 
    The position is jointly funded by Open Targets and the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) projects. Based in the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/" target="_blank">ChEMBL team</a> at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) but working closely 
    with both Open Targets and IDG partners, the appointee will develop computational and informatics methods that exploit the data integrated in the <a href="http://www.targetvalidation.org" target="_blank">Open Targets Platform</a> and 
    the <a href="https://pharos.nih.gov/" target="_blank">IDG Pharos Platform</a>. 
    together with other public resources as applicable. The overall goal of this project is to develop methods and insights that exploit these platforms to help drive decisions on target identification and 
    prioritisation in the wider drug discovery and bioscience community.
