    The EBI–Sanger Postdoctoral (ESPOD) Programme builds on the collaborative relationship between EMBL-EBI and the Wellcome Sanger Institute, offering projects that combine experimental (wet-lab) and computational (dry-lab) approaches.
    The project, Investigation of genetic signatures associated with pharmacological outcomes for immune diseases, will be supervised by Ellen McDonagh (Informatics Science Director - Open Targets ), Gosia Trynka (Experimental Science Director - Open Targets),
    and Emma Davenport (Group Leader, Functional Genomics - Sanger). For more information, please review the <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/sites/ebi.ac.uk/files/shared/ESPOD_2020_McDonagh_Trynka_Davenport.pdf' target='_blank'>project description</a>.

    We are looking for a highly motivated Bioinformatician/Senior Bioinformatician to contribute to the development of the analysis pipelines behind EMBL-EBI’s Expression Atlas and particularly 
    the Single Cell Expression Atlas, an added-value database providing information about gene expression in single cells across different cell types, tissues and conditions, across all species. 
    You will develop, maintain and deploy robust analysis pipelines for single cell RNA-seq. You will participate in collaborative projects aiming to add value to large cell atlas datasets by implementing 
    cell type annotation and cell type deconvolution strategies. In addition, you will also be contributing to the maintenance and running of our bulk RNA-Seq pipelines 
    for our existing service Expression Atlas.

    We are seeking an enthusiastic Bioinformatician to join the Open Targets Core Team and contribute to the development of the Open Targets Platform. As a member of the Data team within the Core team, 
    your role will involve the integration and analysis of the most relevant data sources, as well as building the appropriate models for integrating and scoring targets-disease associations. 
    A good understanding of the biological questions that surround the drug discovery hypothesis is highly recommended. The role also involves collaborating closely with data providers across the Open Targets 
    consortia, and demonstrating initiative in the development and refinement of suitable data feeds. Supported by a team of  software developers, the candidate is expected to leverage the more than 50 data 
    sources we integrate in the Open Targets Platform, in order to better identify and prioritise targets.  Manipulating files representing nested biological data will be a routine part of the role.

    Applications are invited for a 3-year Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Wellcome Sanger Institute based jointly in the teams of 
    Dr. Carl Anderson (Human Genetics Programme) and Dr. Maya Ghoussaini (Open Targets). This is an exciting opportunity for you 
    to bring together cutting-edge genetic and genomic datasets to identify novel candidate therapeutic targets for inflammatory 
    bowel disease (IBD). During this fellowship, you will lead a collaborative project to build a causal evidence base for every 
    gene within IBD associated GWAS loci. As a member of the Anderson group, you will also have access to the latest large-scale genetic 
    association data for IBD, alongside functional genomics datasets derived from disease-relevant tissue in health and disease 
    (single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq). Your affiliation with the Ghoussaini Team will bring access to the massive cross-disease 
    genetic and genomic datasets aggregated by Open Targets and presented in the Platform and Genetics Portal.
