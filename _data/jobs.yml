    The EBIâ€“Sanger Postdoctoral (ESPOD) Programme builds on the collaborative relationship between EMBL-EBI and the Wellcome Sanger Institute, offering projects that combine experimental (wet-lab) and computational (dry-lab) approaches.
    The project, Investigation of genetic signatures associated with pharmacological outcomes for immune diseases, will be supervised by Ellen McDonagh (Informatics Science Director - Open Targets ), Gosia Trynka (Experimental Science Director - Open Targets),
    and Emma Davenport (Group Leader, Functional Genomics - Sanger). For more information, please review the <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/sites/ebi.ac.uk/files/shared/ESPOD_2020_McDonagh_Trynka_Davenport.pdf' target='_blank'>project description</a>.
