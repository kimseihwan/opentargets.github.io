    We are looking for a postdoctoral fellow to join an Open Targets project under the leadership of Dr Ana Cvejic (Wellcome Sanger Institute), Moritz Gerstung (EBI), and Omer Bayraktar (WSI).
    In this project you will analyse newly single cell (scRNA-Seq and scATAC-Seq) as well as novel and spatial transcriptomics data sets (In Situ Sequencing and 10x visium) generated in the Cvejic 
    and Bayraktar labs to understand the molecular properties of immune cells infiltrating tumour sites. The underlying data sets comprise thousands of unique molecular signals measured for tens of 
    thousands of cells or physical locations in each tumour. You will employ methods from high dimensional and spatial statistics developed in the Gerstung group to chart and understand the nature of 
    different tumour-associated immune cells, how they interact and change biological functions and how the underlying molecular changes could be exploited as therapeutic targets.

    An exciting opportunity has been created for a talented safety data scientist to work on methods to characterise and quantify the potential safety liabilities of drug targets. 
    Based in the ChEMBL team at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), you will work with the Open Targets partners to curate data and develop pipelines that 
    will help to inform on the potential safety liabilities of biological targets in the Open Targets Platform.

    The EBI–Sanger Postdoctoral (ESPOD) Programme builds on the collaborative relationship between EMBL-EBI and the Wellcome Sanger Institute, offering projects that combine experimental (wet-lab) and computational (dry-lab) approaches.
    The project, Investigation of genetic signatures associated with pharmacological outcomes for immune diseases, will be supervised by Ellen McDonagh (Informatics Science Director - Open Targets ), Gosia Trynka (Experimental Science Director - Open Targets),
    and Emma Davenport (Group Leader, Functional Genomics - Sanger). For more information, please review the <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/sites/ebi.ac.uk/files/shared/ESPOD_2020_McDonagh_Trynka_Davenport.pdf' target='_blank'>project description</a>.

    We are looking for a highly motivated Bioinformatician/Senior Bioinformatician to contribute to the development of the analysis pipelines behind EMBL-EBI’s Expression Atlas and particularly 
    the Single Cell Expression Atlas, an added-value database providing information about gene expression in single cells across different cell types, tissues and conditions, across all species. 
    You will develop, maintain and deploy robust analysis pipelines for single cell RNA-seq. You will participate in collaborative projects aiming to add value to large cell atlas datasets by implementing 
    cell type annotation and cell type deconvolution strategies. In addition, you will also be contributing to the maintenance and running of our bulk RNA-Seq pipelines 
    for our existing service Expression Atlas.

    Applications are invited for a 3-year Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Wellcome Sanger Institute based jointly in the teams of 
    Dr. Carl Anderson (Human Genetics Programme) and Dr. Maya Ghoussaini (Open Targets). This is an exciting opportunity for you 
    to bring together cutting-edge genetic and genomic datasets to identify novel candidate therapeutic targets for inflammatory 
    bowel disease (IBD). During this fellowship, you will lead a collaborative project to build a causal evidence base for every 
    gene within IBD associated GWAS loci. As a member of the Anderson group, you will also have access to the latest large-scale genetic 
    association data for IBD, alongside functional genomics datasets derived from disease-relevant tissue in health and disease 
    (single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq). Your affiliation with the Ghoussaini Team will bring access to the massive cross-disease 
    genetic and genomic datasets aggregated by Open Targets and presented in the Platform and Genetics Portal.
