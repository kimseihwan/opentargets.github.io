    We are seeking a postdoctoral research fellow to join the <a href="http://kauralasoo.github.io/" target="_blank">Alasoo lab</a> at the <a href="http://www.cs.ut.ee/en" target="_blank">Institute of Computer Science</a>, 
    University of Tartu. The lab focuses on building tools and datasets to systematically interpret genetic variants associated with complex traits, including the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/eqtl" target="_blank">eQTL Catalogue</a>, the 
    largest and most comprehensive database of genetic variants associated with gene expression in the world. This project will build upon the success of the eQTL Catalogue and aims to identify molecular and cellular processes perturbed 
    by disease-associated genetic variants. You will lead the effort to systematically identify genetic variants with distal ('trans-eQTL') effects on gene expression across a range of cell types and tissues present in the eQTL Catalogue 
    and other external datasets.

    We are seeking an experienced and organised Data Manager to help us maximise the impact of the data generated by our project teams at both the Wellcome Sanger Institute and European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI).
    In this role, you will be working to develop and operate the process by which Open Targets project data is managed and shared with Open Targets partners and integrated into the Open Targets Platform and Open Targets Genetics Portal. 
    This involves working with large biological data sets (bulk and Single Cell sequencing & expression, eQTL, CRISPR screening) and managing versioning over time across the academic and industrial partners of Open Targets 
    as part of a multidisciplinary team committed to improving drug target identification and prioritisation.

    The <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/group/trynka-faculty/" target="_blank">Trynka Group</a> at the Wellcome Sanger Institute is looking to recruit a statistical geneticist to join an exciting and ambitious project that will leverage large scale genetic datasets to model allelic series for immune diseases and other complex traits.
    In this role you will explore the existing Open Targets data resources as well as bring in available external data to construct allelic series for immune diseases and other complex traits.
