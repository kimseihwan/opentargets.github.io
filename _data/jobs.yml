    We are seeking two postdoctoral fellows to join an interdisciplinary team on an exciting and ambitious new project using cutting-edge techniques to study how genes associated with neurodegeneration contribute to disease in a cell-type-specific manner. The team will perform targeted CRISPR screens in multiple disease-relevant cell populations derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and assess the resulting phenotypes using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and high throughput cellular assays.

    We are looking for an enthusiastic and talented Full Stack Developer to join the Open Targets Core Platform team 
    and to support the development of our informatics services. The postholder’s primary tasks will be: 1) to 
    support the active development of the Open Targets Platform and Open Targets Genetics Portal applications; and 
    2) to ensure a reliable interface with their respective back-ends. Both applications share a common infrastructure 
    based on React and GraphQL and so we encourage candidates with all levels of experience to apply including 
    Front-End Web Developers and Full Stack Engineers.

    Applications are invited for a 3-year Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Wellcome Sanger Institute based jointly in the teams of 
    Dr. Carl Anderson (Human Genetics Programme) and Dr. Maya Ghoussaini (Open Targets). This is an exciting opportunity for you 
    to bring together cutting-edge genetic and genomic datasets to identify novel candidate therapeutic targets for inflammatory 
    bowel disease (IBD). During this fellowship, you will lead a collaborative project to build a causal evidence base for every 
    gene within IBD associated GWAS loci. Your affiliation with the Ghoussaini Team will bring access to the massive cross-disease 
    genetic and genomic datasets used in the Open Targets Platform and the Open Targets Genetics Portal. And as a member of the 
    Anderson group, you will also have access to the latest large-scale genetic association data for IBD.

    We have an exciting opportunity for a postdoctoral researcher to join an interdisciplinary team on an ambitious project aimed to 
    identify new genes involved in neurodegeneration, especially Alzheimer’s disease. The successful candidate will use human 
    induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived microglia coupled with cutting edge high-throughput single cell 'omics techniques 
    to assay the effects of natural and induced genetic variation on gene expression and cellular phenotypes. The overall aim is to 
    identify novel genes involved in important microglial cellular processes that are relevant for disease biology and will therefore 
    be candidate drug targets for further development.
