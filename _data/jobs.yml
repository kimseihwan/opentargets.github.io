    We are looking for a highly motivated Bioinformatician/Senior Bioinformatician to contribute to the development of the analysis pipelines behind EMBL-EBI’s Expression Atlas and particularly 
    the Single Cell Expression Atlas, an added-value database providing information about gene expression in single cells across different cell types, tissues and conditions, across all species. 
    You will develop, maintain and deploy robust analysis pipelines for single cell RNA-seq. You will participate in collaborative projects aiming to add value to large cell atlas datasets by implementing 
    cell type annotation and cell type deconvolution strategies. In addition, you will also be contributing to the maintenance and running of our bulk RNA-Seq pipelines 
    for our existing service Expression Atlas.

    We are seeking a motivated and experienced scientist in cancer molecular biology and genetics to lead the expansion and curation of the Cancer Gene Census at the Wellcome Sanger Institute within COSMIC, 
    a database of genetic mutations in cancer, a major resource in cancer research, widely used across informatics, diagnostic and pharmaceutical industries. This is an exciting position within the COSMIC team, 
    where you will have the opportunity to explore & interpret a wide range of literature, database and analytic resources to create a complete landscape of genetic dysfunctions across all cancer types and explain 
    which molecular mechanisms are most important in development of these diseases. Our first aim is to expand the Cancer Gene Census with new genes, and to generate full descriptive coverage of all Census genes 
    with evidence of oncogenic activity. The Cancer Gene Census is frequently cited in publications and regularly used as a key data source in cancer genome analytics and databases; this project extends this 
    high-profile resource, offering multiple opportunities for very citeable publications. This position is available for 18 months with a possibility of extension.

    We are seeking an enthusiastic Bioinformatician to join the Open Targets Core Team and contribute to the development of the Open Targets Platform. As a member of the Data team within the Core team, 
    your role will involve the integration and analysis of the most relevant data sources, as well as building the appropriate models for integrating and scoring targets-disease associations. 
    A good understanding of the biological questions that surround the drug discovery hypothesis is highly recommended. The role also involves collaborating closely with data providers across the Open Targets 
    consortia, and demonstrating initiative in the development and refinement of suitable data feeds. Supported by a team of  software developers, the candidate is expected to leverage the more than 50 data 
    sources we integrate in the Open Targets Platform, in order to better identify and prioritise targets.  Manipulating files representing nested biological data will be a routine part of the role.

    Applications are invited for a 3-year Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Wellcome Sanger Institute based jointly in the teams of 
    Dr. Carl Anderson (Human Genetics Programme) and Dr. Maya Ghoussaini (Open Targets). This is an exciting opportunity for you 
    to bring together cutting-edge genetic and genomic datasets to identify novel candidate therapeutic targets for inflammatory 
    bowel disease (IBD). During this fellowship, you will lead a collaborative project to build a causal evidence base for every 
    gene within IBD associated GWAS loci. As a member of the Anderson group, you will also have access to the latest large-scale genetic 
    association data for IBD, alongside functional genomics datasets derived from disease-relevant tissue in health and disease 
    (single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq). Your affiliation with the Ghoussaini Team will bring access to the massive cross-disease 
    genetic and genomic datasets aggregated by Open Targets and presented in the Platform and Genetics Portal.
