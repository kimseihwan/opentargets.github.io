    We are seeking a Statistical Geneticist to join the Open Targets Genetics team under the leadership of Dr. Maya Ghoussaini. 
    This is an exciting opportunity for you to participate in the enhancement of the <a href="http://genetics.opentargets.org" target="_blank">Open Targets Genetics Portal</a>
    through the development of new functionality and features. The Open Targets Genetics Portal uses cutting-edge methods to aggregate large scale GWAS data with functional genomics 
    data to identify potential drug targets at disease-associated loci. In this role, you will be actively engaged in the integration of new GWAS data (FinnGen, Biobank Japan, etc), 
    eQTL datasets including splice QTLs and tissue-specific functional genomic datasets. You will develop and apply computational pipelines to elucidate causal mechanisms through 
    integrative analyses of data from GWAS, eQTL/pQTL, chromatin interactions and conformation, biobanks, and other related sources to identify and prioritise drug targets.

    We are seeking an enthusiastic Bioinformatician to join our team and contribute to the development of the <a href="http://targetvalidation.org" target="_blank">Open Targets Platform</a>, 
    a freely-available, open-source tool that supports systematic drug target identification and prioritsation. As a member of the Data team within the broader Platform team, your role will involve 
    the integration and analysis of the most relevant data sources, as well as building the appropriate models for integrating and scoring targets-disease associations. The role also involves 
    collaborating closely with data providers across the Open Targets consortia and demonstrating initiative in the development and refinement of suitable data feeds. Supported by a team of 
    software developers, the postholder is expected to leverage the more than 50 data sources we integrate in the Platform, in order to better identify and prioritise potential drug targets.
