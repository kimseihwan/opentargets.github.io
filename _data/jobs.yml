    The <a href='https://www.sanger.ac.uk/group/trynka-faculty/' target='_blank'>Trynka Group</a>, led by our Experimental Science Director Gosia Trynka, is looking to recruit a collaborative and motivated Principal Bioinformatician. As part of the <a href='https://www.sanger.ac.uk/programme/human-genetics/' target='_blank'>Human Genetics Program</a>
    at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, the Trynka Group works closely with Open Targets on translational research that informs new therapies for immune diseases. This is an exciting opportunity to lead cutting edge science and contribute to the development of research strategy. In this role, you will take a leading role in the informatics support for 
    projects within the group. Your interactions will range across a spectrum of computational and experimental researchers and you will work with diverse types of data, including very large single cell transcriptomics data and different types of CRISPR screens.

    Applications are invited for a Research Assistant to join the team of Dr Emmanouil Metzakopian, in the newly established UK Dementia Research Institute (UK DRI) Centre at the University of Cambridge based at the Cambridge Biomedical Campus. 
    The focus of the <a href='http://www.metzakopianlab.org/' target='_blank'>Metzakopian lab</a> is on insights into novel neuroprotective mechanisms in neurodegeneration that provide new targets for treatments of these disorders. This will involve planning, performing and evaluating experiments to generate 
    targeted human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, optimisation of CRISPR-Cas9 in iPS cellderived cortical neural progenitors and mature neurons, and development of robust cellular assays.
