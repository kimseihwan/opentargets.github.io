    We are seeking a Statistical Geneticist to join the Open Targets Genetics team under the leadership of Dr. Maya Ghoussaini. 
    This is an exciting opportunity for you to participate in the enhancement of the <a href="http://genetics.opentargets.org" target="_blank">Open Targets Genetics Portal</a>
    through the development of new functionality and features. The Open Targets Genetics Portal uses cutting-edge methods to aggregate large scale GWAS data with functional genomics 
    data to identify potential drug targets at disease-associated loci. In this role, you will be actively engaged in the integration of new GWAS data (FinnGen, Biobank Japan, etc), 
    eQTL datasets including splice QTLs and tissue-specific functional genomic datasets. You will develop and apply computational pipelines to elucidate causal mechanisms through 
    integrative analyses of data from GWAS, eQTL/pQTL, chromatin interactions and conformation, biobanks, and other related sources to identify and prioritise drug targets.

    We are seeking an enthusiastic and motivated scientist to provide experimental, scientific and operational support to the <a href="https://www.opentargets.org/validation-lab" target="_blank">Open Targets Validation Lab</a> at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. As a key member of the Validation Lab team, you will work closely with academic and industry partners to facilitate the transfer of expertise 
    and technology in neurodegeneration research to the Validation Lab and generate experimental evidence with the aim of identifying new routes to therapeutic intervention. You will perform genetic and pharmacological target perturbation experiments in a variety of neuronal, microglial and astrocyte cellular models, 
    derived from hiPSCs using the latest directed- and transcription factor-driven differentiation protocols. Using state-of-the-art phenotyping methodologies, such as scRNAseq, scATACseq, FACS, live-cell and high-content imaging, you will interrogate targets through a variety of assay endpoints.
