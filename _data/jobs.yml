    We are seeking an experienced and organised Data Manager to help us maximise the impact of the data generated by our project teams at both the Wellcome Sanger Institute and European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI).
    In this role, you will be working to develop and operate the process by which Open Targets project data is managed and shared with Open Targets partners and integrated into the Open Targets Platform and Open Targets Genetics Portal. 
    This involves working with large biological data sets (bulk and Single Cell sequencing & expression, eQTL, CRISPR screening) and managing versioning over time across the academic and industrial partners of Open Targets 
    as part of a multidisciplinary team committed to improving drug target identification and prioritisation.
