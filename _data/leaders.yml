      Jeffrey Barrett has been involved in Open Targets since it launched as the CTTV in 2014 and began his role as Director on 1 May 2015. Jeff is a statistical geneticist who has led several of the largest genome-wide association studies of complex disease. He first became interested in human genetics in Mark Daly’s lab at the Whitehead Institute before moving to Lon Cardon’s group in Oxford, where he received a D. Phil in statistical genetics. Jeff was an analyst in the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, and led early GWAS meta-analyses in inflammatory bowel disease and type 1 diabetes while a postdoc with David Clayton in Cambridge. Since joining the Sanger Institute as a group leader in 2008, he has used next-generation sequencing in thousands of individuals to find variation associated with both rare and common human diseases.

  bio: >
      Ian Dunham has been involved in genomics since around the time the term was coined. He obtained his D. Phil from Oxford University in 1989, determining the long-range structure of the human MHC. During his postdoctoral studies he worked with the genomic pioneer Maynard Olson in St Louis, before returning to the UK to construct a physical map of human chromosome 22. At the Sanger Centre from 1993 his work focussed first on genome sequencing including the first human chromosome sequence in 1999, and subsequently on developing functional maps of the human genome. This included gene structure maps, variation maps, and the first chromosome-wide linkage disequilibrium map. Recently Ian's research interests include experimental and computational approaches to genome-wide mapping of regulatory elements and chromatin state in the human genome as part of the NHGRI ENCODE project, as well as understanding the influence of variation on regulatory elements in human and other organisms. Ian has been at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) in Cambridge, UK since 2007.

      Dr Philippe Sanseau is Head of Computational Biology at GSK. He has a PhD from University of Rennes in France and conducted his postdoctoral training at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in London (now Cancer Research UK), with a focus on immunogenetics. He joined GSK to work initially in the Genetics and Genomics Departments. Since 2001 he has held various senior roles in bioinformatics and computational biology. Philippe is currently leading the Computational Biology (CB) Department at GSK with scientists located in the UK and US. The CB Department is working on multiple therapeutic areas supporting drug discovery and development projects at all phases of the pipeline using diverse bioinformatics approaches applied to biomedical internal and external data. The Department maintains a strong scientific innovation agenda as demonstrated by our activities in target validation, drug repositioning, systems approaches, or microbiome analyses. CB at GSK has also developed an international network of academic collaborators and maintains a strong publication record. Philippe is a member of several international advisory boards and different UK and international funding committees.

  bio: >
      Dr Mathew Garnett leads the Translational Cancer Genomics laboratory and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer Project at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. Mathew's team uses high-throughput drug sensitivity screens and genome-editing technology in cancer and normal human cells to understand how cancer genes contribute to disease and to facilitate the development of new treatments. After obtaining a BSc in Biochemistry (Hons.) at the University of British Columbia, Canada, Mathew completed his PhD with Prof. Richard Marais at the Institute of Cancer Research (London, UK) on the characterisation of BRAF as a cancer gene.  In 2005 Mathew moved to the laboratory of Prof. Ashok Venkitaraman (Cambridge, UK) for his post-doctoral research, where he discovered a new regulator of cell division.  Mathew joined the Sanger Institute in 2009.
