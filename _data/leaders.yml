  bio: >
      Ian has been involved in genomics since around the time the term was coined. He obtained his D. Phil from Oxford University in 1989, determining the long-range structure of the human MHC. During his postdoctoral studies he worked with the genomic pioneer Maynard Olson in St Louis, before returning to the UK to construct a physical map of human chromosome 22. At the Sanger Centre from 1993 his work focussed first on genome sequencing including the first human chromosome sequence in 1999, and subsequently on developing functional maps of the human genome. This included gene structure maps, variation maps, and the first chromosome-wide linkage disequilibrium map. Recently Ian's research interests include experimental and computational approaches to genome-wide mapping of regulatory elements and chromatin state in the human genome as part of the NHGRI ENCODE project, as well as understanding the influence of variation on regulatory elements in human and other organisms. Ian has been at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) in Cambridge, UK since 2007.
