    Ian has been involved in genomics since around the time the term was coined. 
    He obtained his D. Phil from Oxford University in 1989, determining the 
    long-range structure of the human MHC. During his postdoctoral studies 
    he worked with the genomic pioneer Maynard Olson in St Louis, before returning 
    to the UK to construct a physical map of human chromosome 22. At the 
    Sanger Centre from 1993 his work focussed first on genome sequencing including 
    the first human chromosome sequence in 1999, and subsequently on developing 
    functional maps of the human genome. This included gene structure maps, 
    variation maps, and the first chromosome-wide linkage disequilibrium map. 
    Recently Ian's research interests include experimental and computational 
    approaches to genome-wide mapping of regulatory elements and chromatin state 
    in the human genome as part of the NHGRI ENCODE project, as well as 
    understanding the influence of variation on regulatory elements in human and 
    other organisms. Ian has been at the European Bioinformatics organisation 
    (EMBL-EBI) in Cambridge, UK since 2007.

    David has a PhD from the University of Cambridge in Organic Chemistry 
    and conducted postdoctoral research at the University of Toronto in Canada. 
    He joined GSK in 2007 initially in the Process Chemistry group to develop 
    manufacturing processes for small molecule therapies.  Through his time at 
    GSK he has held project leadership and line management roles in R&D and led 
    research and technology transfer programmes between R&D and Global 
    Manufacturing. Before joining Open Targets David was engaged in developing 
    and implementing strategic projects for GSK through a secondment to the 
    office of the CEO and CFO as part of the CEOâ€™s Future Strategy Group. 
    As Operations Director, David oversees the management of a number of 
    informatics and experimental target validation projects as well as ensuring 
    the strategic deployment and operational translation of Open Targets.
