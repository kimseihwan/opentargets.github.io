    Mathew leads the Translational Cancer Genomics laboratory and Genomics of 
    Drug Sensitivity in Cancer Project at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. 
    Mathew's team uses high-throughput drug sensitivity screens and genome-editing 
    technology in cancer and normal human cells to understand how cancer genes 
    contribute to disease and to facilitate the development of new treatments. 
    After obtaining a BSc in Biochemistry (Hons.) at the University of British 
    Columbia, Canada, Mathew completed his PhD with Prof. Richard Marais at the 
    Institute of Cancer Research (London, UK) on the characterisation of BRAF 
    as a cancer gene. In 2005 Mathew moved to the laboratory of Prof. Ashok 
    Venkitaraman (Cambridge, UK) for his post-doctoral research, where he 
    discovered a new regulator of cell division. Mathew joined the Wellcome 
    Sanger Institute in 2009.
