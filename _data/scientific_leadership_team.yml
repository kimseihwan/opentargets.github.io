    Mathew leads the Translational Cancer Genomics laboratory and Genomics of 
    Drug Sensitivity in Cancer Project at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. 
    Mathew's team uses high-throughput drug sensitivity screens and genome-editing 
    technology in cancer and normal human cells to understand how cancer genes 
    contribute to disease and to facilitate the development of new treatments. 
    After obtaining a BSc in Biochemistry (Hons.) at the University of British 
    Columbia, Canada, Mathew completed his PhD with Prof. Richard Marais at the 
    Institute of Cancer Research (London, UK) on the characterisation of BRAF 
    as a cancer gene. In 2005 Mathew moved to the laboratory of Prof. Ashok 
    Venkitaraman (Cambridge, UK) for his post-doctoral research, where he 
    discovered a new regulator of cell division. Mathew joined the Wellcome 
    Sanger Institute in 2009.

    Joe is a Principal Scientist in the Informatics and Predictive Sciences group at 
    Celgene, working closely with the Immunology and Inflammation Therapeutic Center of 
    Excellence. In this role, he uses human genetics to identify novel drug targets, enable 
    indication selection, perform internal pharmacogenetic studies, and support other aspects 
    of drug development. Prior to Celgene, he worked in the Genetics and Pharmacogenomics 
    group at Merck & Co (MSD), where he focused on mapping molecular QTL (e.g. pQTL) and 
    integrating these data with disease GWAS to enable target identification. He has an 
    interdisciplinary background in statistical human genetics, computational biology, and 
    pharmacology. He completed a postdoctoral fellowship in Clinical Pharmacology at the 
    University of Chicago in 2014, and was certified by the American Board of Clinical 
    Pharmacology in 2015. He received his PhD in Human Genetics from the University of 
    Chicago in 2012, where he used eQTL mapping and other functional genomics approaches 
    to understand the molecular basis of drug response phenotypes.

  biography: >
    Moritz leads a research group at EMBL-EBI investigating the underlying mechanisms of 
    cancer development and seeking to understand the differences in therapy success and 
    outcomes in different individuals. His team develops statistical models for relating 
    different layers of genomic, molecular and clinical data to establish connections 
    between genotype and phenotype, and tools to predict outcomes based on comprehensive, 
    high-dimensional datasets. The group also explores the evolutionary dynamics of cancer. 
    He has a PhD in Computational Biology from ETH Zurich (2012), and carried out 
    postdoctoral work at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (2012-2015). Moritz joined 
    EMBL-EBI as a Research group leader in August 2015.
