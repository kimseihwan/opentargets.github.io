Leadership
Director

Dr Jeffrey Barrett
Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI)
Jeffrey Barrett has been involved in Open Targets since it launched as the CTTV in 2014 and began his role as Director on 1 May 2015. Jeff is a statistical geneticist who has led several of the largest genome-wide association studies of complex disease. He first became interested in human genetics in Mark Daly’s lab at the Whitehead Institute before moving to Lon Cardon’s group in Oxford, where he received a D. Phil in statistical genetics. Jeff was an analyst in the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, and led early GWAS meta-analyses in inflammatory bowel disease and type 1 diabetes while a postdoc with David Clayton in Cambridge. Since joining the Sanger Institute as a group leader in 2008, he has used next-generation sequencing in thousands of individuals to find variation associated with both rare and common human diseases.

Scientific Director

Dr Ian Dunham
European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI)
Ian Dunham has been involved in genomics since around the time the term was coined. He obtained his D. Phil from Oxford University in 1989, determining the long-range structure of the human MHC. During his postdoctoral studies he worked with the genomic pioneer Maynard Olson in St Louis, before returning to the UK to construct a physical map of human chromosome 22. At the Sanger Centre from 1993 his work focussed first on genome sequencing including the first human chromosome sequence in 1999, and subsequently on developing functional maps of the human genome. This included gene structure maps, variation maps, and the first chromosome-wide linkage disequilibrium map. Recently Ian's research interests include experimental and computational approaches to genome-wide mapping of regulatory elements and chromatin state in the human genome as part of the NHGRI ENCODE project, as well as understanding the influence of variation on regulatory elements in human and other organisms. Ian has been at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) in Cambridge, UK since 2007.

Operations Director

Dr David Hulcoop
GSK
David has a PhD from the University of Cambridge in Organic Chemistry and conducted postdoctoral research at the University of Toronto in Canada.  He joined GSK in 2007 initially in the Process Chemistry group to develop manufacturing processes for small molecule therapies.  Through his time at GSK he has held project leadership and line management roles in R&D and led research and technology transfer programmes between R&D and Global Manufacturing.  Before joining Open Targets David was engaged in developing and implementing strategic projects for GSK through a secondment to the office of the CEO and CFO as part of the CEO’s Future Strategy Group.  As Operations Director, David oversees the management of a number of informatics and experimental target validation projects as well as ensuring the strategic deployment and operational translation of Open Targets.

Biogen Scientific Lead

Aaron Day-Williams
Associate Director, Head of Statistical Genetics at Biogen
Aaron Day-Williams is a statistical geneticist and bioinformatician interested in utilizing human genetics to elucidate new targets, identify biomarkers and stratify patients. He joined Biogen in May 2012. Before joining Biogen he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Hinxton, UK, where he studied the genetics of osteoarthritis, type II diabetes and body mass index using 1000 genomes imputation-based GWAS, whole-exome sequencing and whole-genome sequencing. In addition to the gene-mapping projects, he was involved in developing methods for the analysis of rare variants. Aaron's graduate work was performed in the labs of Dr. Eric Sobel and Dr. Kenneth Lange at UCLA, where he developed a set of methods to estimate kinship coefficients for use in gene mapping methods from GWAS chip genotyping without prior information on relationships.

Joint EMBL-EBI Scientific Lead

Maria Martin
Protein function (Development) Team Leader, European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI)
Dr  Maria  Martin is the Team Leader of Protein function developments at EMBL-EBI. She manages  the  bioinformatics  infrastructure  of  the Universal  Protein Resource  (UniProt), the  world  leading  database  of  classified  and  functionally  annotated  protein sequences. Her group also manages and develops software for the Gene Ontology annotation and the  Enzyme portal projects.  She holds a M.Sc. in Veterinary Medicine and a PhD in Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics, and she has been working in developing infrastructure for scientific data for 19 years. Her  research  interests  include the  study of  novel  methods for protein function prediction, and protein annotation and visualization.

Joint EMBL-EBI Scientific Lead

Oliver Stegle
Research Group Leader, European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI)
Oliver Stegle is a Research Group Leader at EMBL-EBI. Oliver's team develops and applies advances statistical and machine learning methods to fully exploit high-throughput molecular data. He is particularly interested methods to link genotype to molecular traits and phenotypes and computational single-cell biology. Prior to his work at EMBL-EBI, he received his PhD from the University of Cambridge (2009) while working with David MacKay on statistical machine learning and computational biology. He did his postdoctoral work at the Max Planck campus Tuebingen (2009-2012) before setting up his own group at EMBL-EBI in 2012.

GSK Scientific Lead

Dr Philippe Sanseau
Head of Computational Biology, GSK
Dr Philippe Sanseau is Head of Computational Biology at GSK. He has a PhD from University of Rennes in France and conducted his postdoctoral training at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in London (now Cancer Research UK), with a focus on immunogenetics. He joined GSK to work initially in the Genetics and Genomics Departments. Since 2001 he has held various senior roles in bioinformatics and computational biology. Philippe is currently leading the Computational Biology (CB) Department at GSK with scientists located in the UK and US. The CB Department is working on multiple therapeutic areas supporting drug discovery and development projects at all phases of the pipeline using diverse bioinformatics approaches applied to biomedical internal and external data. The Department maintains a strong scientific innovation agenda as demonstrated by our activities in target validation, drug repositioning, systems approaches, or microbiome analyses. CB at GSK has also developed an international network of academic collaborators and maintains a strong publication record. Philippe is a member of several international advisory boards and different UK and international funding committees.

WTSI Scientific Lead

Dr Mathew Garnett
Translational Cancer Genomics Laboratory Group Leader, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute
Dr Mathew Garnett leads the Translational Cancer Genomics laboratory and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer Project at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. Mathew's team uses high-throughput drug sensitivity screens and genome-editing technology in cancer and normal human cells to understand how cancer genes contribute to disease and to facilitate the development of new treatments. After obtaining a BSc in Biochemistry (Hons.) at the University of British Columbia, Canada, Mathew completed his PhD with Prof. Richard Marais at the Institute of Cancer Research (London, UK) on the characterisation of BRAF as a cancer gene.  In 2005 Mathew moved to the laboratory of Prof. Ashok Venkitaraman (Cambridge, UK) for his post-doctoral research, where he discovered a new regulator of cell division.  Mathew joined the Sanger Institute in 2009.
