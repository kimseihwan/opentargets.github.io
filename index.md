<!-- Open Targets is a public-private initiative to generate evidence on the validity of therapeutic targets based on genome-scale experiments and analysis. -->Open Targets is an innovative, large-scale, multi-year, public-private partnership that uses human genetics and genomics data for systematic drug target identification and prioritisation.


Visit the [Open Targets Platform](https://www.targetvalidation.org) which integrates public domain data to enable target identification and prioritisation, or [Open Targets Genetics](https://genetics.opentargets.org) which identifies targets based on GWAS and functional genomics.

## Sanofi joins Open Targets
*Cambridge, 29 October 2018*
Open Targets announced today that Sanofi has joined its pioneering public-private collaboration to transform drug discovery by improving the success rate for developing new medicines. Sanofi’s expertise in immunology, oncology, neurosciences and diabetes will complement the offerings of the current partners GSK, Biogen, Takeda, Celgene, the Wellcome Sanger Institute and EMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI).

## Overview
Generating and interpreting the data required to identify a good drug target demands a diverse set of skills, backgrounds, evidence types and technologies, which do not exist today in any single entity. Open Targets brings together expertise from seven complementary institutions to systematically identify and prioritise targets from which safe and effective medicines can be developed.

Our goals are to:
*	Systematically find the best targets to safely & effectively treat disease
*	Help others find good targets
*	Get those targets adopted into drug discovery pipelines


We currently focus on oncology, immunology and neurodegeneration through an R&D framework that can be applied to all aspects of human disease. We believe that evidence generated in the most human relevant systems showing which targets are causing disease will have a significant impact on the successful development of new medicines. To build a good therapeutic hypothesis we need to find not only which targets are involved but also how we might alter complex disease mechanisms, and how predictive laboratory and animal results are for humans.

Open Targets is committed to openly sharing our data with the scientific community through publications, the internationally recognised databases and the [Open Targets Platform](https://www.targetvalidation.org). Access our [resources.](resources)

We welcome discussions with new partners who share our philosophies and scientific interests.  Get to know [our team](people) and find our [contact details.](contact)
