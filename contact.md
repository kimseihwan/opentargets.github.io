## Help us improve the Open Targets Platform!
The [Open Targets Platform](https://www.targetvalidation.org) aims to support researchers in identifying early drug targets faster and with more confidence. The platform integrates data from several public databases and is the result of a collaboration between the Sanger Institute, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and Biogen. 

As part of our ongoing efforts to improve this valuable public resource, we want to talk to experimental biology researchers who study associations of human genes with diseases. We are interested in understanding how well the platform meets your needs and what other information and features would make it more useful to you. A typical session takes about an hour of your time. Previous participants have found them to be a lot of fun!

If you would like to talk to us, please email [contact@opentargets.org][email].
